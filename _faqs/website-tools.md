I've been on a [static site generator]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-03-19-going-static %}) kick the last couple of years and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to compile my site. The basic idea is I write a bunch of text files in MarkDown and using my hand-rolled templates stylesheets Jekyll spits out a bunch of HTML files that I sync with my webserver.

* Text editor: [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com)
* Task runner: [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
* Version control: Git
* Web hosting: [Media Temple](http://mediatemple.com)

If you're really interested in the specifics of how the site is built I've made its source available on GitHub for anyone to fork and download. And because I'm such a cool dude I've also open sourced a couple of [Jekyll themes]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /work/2014-02-28-jekyll-themes %}) for you to use and abuse --- you're welcome!
