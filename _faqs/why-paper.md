It's hard to explain but Paper's tools feel more natural to me than other iOS sketching apps. An app like [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/) --- while full of impressive features simply doesn't hold the same appeal for me.

I suppose the main reason I enjoy Paper over the rest is the challenge of capturing realism with it. With other apps it's fairly trivial to import a photograph and trace over it and fake your way through it --- Paper not so much. When creating an illustration in Paper you have to approach it like you would with physical tools and media. I like that.
