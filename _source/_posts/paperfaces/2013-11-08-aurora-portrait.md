Something a little different from the normal no face, square format composition. PaperFaces portrait commission for <a href="http://twitter.com/bobbydharrell">@bobbydharrell</a> of his daughter Aurora.

First drawing I've completed since receiving yet another replacement Pogo Connect.

Perhaps I should take a look at the Pogo iOS app to see if I can adjust the tip's sensitivity...
