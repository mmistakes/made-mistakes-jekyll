As I continue to hack away at the design of Made Mistakes and improve on things, I've tried to release a simplified Jekyll starter after each major revision. Just my way of giving back to the community.

Below are all of the Jekyll starters I've open sourced thus far. Each "theme" contains `_layouts`, `_includes`, assets, and sample pages to get you started. For the most part they share a lot of similarities (especially in `_config.yml`), which should make switching and updating easier.

## Skinny Bones

A new Jekyll starter I've been working on that I used to build the latest incarnation of Made Mistakes. Full documentation coming soon…

* Minimal design meant to be hacked up and customized
* Built in support for Sass and data files (requires Jekyll 2.x)
* Off canvas menu
* Tile based archives
* Optional table of contents, ads, and Disqus comments modules, and more
