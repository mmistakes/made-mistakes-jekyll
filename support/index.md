The *Paper by FiftyThree* tutorials, Jekyll themes, and other articles I publish in my free time have been a true labor of love. If you've found any of them useful and want to thank me, here's a few ways you can.

## Spread the Word

Have a website or use social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, or Pinterest? Please consider sharing any content from **Made Mistakes** or linking directly to <{{ site.url }}>

## Follow Me on Social Media

I post once or twice a day --- you don't have to worry about me barfing out a stream of rants and retweets in quick succession. Content shared is along the lines of sarcastic remarks, Paper by FiftyThree drawings, web design and development tidbits, and photographic fragments from what little life I live.

## Sponsorships

If you have a product, service, or application that you'd like me to take a look at feel free to [reach out]({{ site.url }}/about/). I'm open to writing about it if I think there's value for my readers or fits in with the iPad art, design, and web development content I typically publish.
