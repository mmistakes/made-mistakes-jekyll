So we went and saw **Paranormal Activity** last night. If you haven't heard it's basically the **Blair Witch Project** shot in a haunted house. I couldn't have planned it better because earlier in the day my [Eviltron from Think Geek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/c427/) showed up which gave me time to plant it in our bedroom.

The fact that we just saw a movie about strange noises and ghosts, made hiding the Eviltron perfect for some effective scares. At first I acted startled at the scratching noises and played it up as if there was a mouse or rodent in our attic. But when the small child laughed and it whispered "hey, can you hear me?" Wendy freaked out and I had to end the prank. Pretty sure she was ready to runaway and go to her parents' house for the night.

Trick or treat!!!
