Three days later I'm still impressed with the **Palm Pre**. As a user of Palm OS smartphones (Treo 600, Treo 650, Centro), I've come to rely on a proven feature set.

The experience of having a device that organizes your life, makes phone calls, and connects online --- has remained unchanged. For the most part the Palm Pre meets or exceeds my expectations, with only a few minor back steps. After the break is a full rundown of my Palm Pre likes and dislikes (mostly software related), in no particular order.

## Palm Pre positives

* Device feels great in your hands. *(Not sure where all the "it feels cheap" reviews came from.)*
* Screen looks awesome!
* The UI is very slick.
* webOS is very responsive and allows **true multitasking**.
* Notifications are handled very elegantly.
* Push Gmail. *(Emails hit my Palm Pre before my desktop --- sweet!)*
* Synergy and the way that it syncs with "the cloud." *(ie: Google, Facebook, etc)*
* Battery life. *(I can easily make it through a workday which is all I had hoped for)*
* Removable battery.
* Physical keyboard. *(Yes it's small, but coming from a Centro I have no problems banging out txts or emails.)*
* Plugging in via USB let's you access the ringtone and wallpaper folders, to easily add your own to the device.
* Is capable of syncing with iTunes to add music, podcasts, videos, movies, or photos.
* Backups every day to your Palm Profile --- just in case you need to restore your device after a wipe.
* GPS and Sprint Navigation for turn by turn directions.

## Palm Pre negatives

* Having to pay $30 for the Classic app. Booooooooo!
* Having to use Classic at all! Let's get true webOS versions on the App Catalog so I can stop using Classic for a few archaic applications.
* No option to make *Tasks repeatable* like the Palm OS version. *(Maybe I'm the only one who relies on this --- I dunno)*
* Tasks don't sync up with Google Tasks. *(I'm sure this will happen eventually)*
* Flipping through the Calendar is painfully slow.
* No agenda view in Calendar.
* Sprint Navigation doesn't pull in your contacts' addresses if they're coming from Google or Facebook accounts.
* Can't change the notification sound. *(I have no desire to change it but it would be nice to have the option)*
* Can't assign a default ringtone for unknown callers like in Palm OS devices.
* Reception issues. *(I've never had more than 2 bars at my house with the **Centro**, but the Palm Pre seems to average much less and I've experienced a few dropped calls)*
* Landscape mode is limited to only a few applications
* USB port cover seems cheaply made and I feel like I'm going to break it off every time I open it.
* Device does get warm after prolonged usage. *(To be fair so did my Centro)*
* Audio speaker isn't that loud.

So there you have it. Can't say that I was excited about the thought of paying an extra $20 a month for the required Sprint Everything Data plan. But seeing how I'm getting more anytime minutes, Sprint Navigation, Sprint TV, and nights that start at 7pm instead of 9pm --- I'll live. My only real Palm Pre complaints stem from its software or lack of applications, which I'm pretty confident will be addressed with future firmware and software updates. I hope :wink:
