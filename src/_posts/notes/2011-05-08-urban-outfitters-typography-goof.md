Glad to see improvements in the May 2011 Urban Outfitters catalog. Especially since I took [a few issues with the typography](/articles/typography-urban-outfitters/) and other design choices last month.

## A step in the right direction

I was shocked to see product copy that was almost legible and set in a serif typeface instead of a sans ([P22 Underground](https://web.archive.org/web/20111111003402/http://www.p22.com/products/underground.html)). Plus they even made a half effort to number blocks of text with corresponding photographs on the page (see below for example). Although it would have been nice if they actually captioned the photographs so I don't have to think as much

{% figure caption:"The serif typeface used here is quite beautiful --- especially the ampersand glyph and italic set." %}

## How to ruin good photography with bad typography

Sullied by page spreads that are obviously more interested in making beautiful pictures than helping customers make informed buying decisions.

{% figure caption:"It's really hard to tell what this catalog is trying to sell, beautiful photographs or clothing and accessories?" %}

{% endfigure %}

I've tired trying to discover any sort of detail on the clothing and product sold in this catalog. I mean how could I? You basically need a magnifying glass and more patience I'm willing to waste trying to sort out what price and item number goes with each photograph.

{% figure caption:"Looks like someone's RETURN key is busted. Unless it was intentionally set to generate headaches..." %}
