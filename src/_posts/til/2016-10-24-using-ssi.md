In my never ending quest to micro-optimize the hell out of my site, I ran into a snag when trying to use SSI directives.

[Version 10.2](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/10.3.0) of this site was my half-baked attempt at [eliminating render-blocking CSS]({% post_url /articles/2016-02-17-using-jekyll-2016 %}#critical-path-css) to speed up page loads. By manually inlining critical CSS via a [Jekyll include](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes) and using [**loadCSS**](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) to asynchronously load the rest --- I did pretty good.

This workflow wasn't ideal for a variety of reasons:

1. Manual process.
2. Need to maintain separate "critical" stylesheets for inlining.
3. Included a bunch of declarations that aren't critical to rendering "above the fold" content ---  causing some file size bloat.

So with the help of [**Critical**](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) (and friends) I attempted to automated the process. Getting it working within the constraints of a Jekyll site with thousands of posts wasn't easy, but I got close with [a set of Gulp tasks](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/gulp/tasks). A tale for another day unfortunately...

Sorry a little off topic there, back to SSI directives.

I learned that to speed up things for repeat visitors, loading a cached version of the CSS instead of waiting for **loadCSS** to do its thing was preferred. By using Filament Group's aptly named [**Enhance.js**](https://github.com/filamentgroup/enhance) project as a boilerplate, this could be achieved by dropping a cookie and using SSI directives.

Structuring our HTML looks a little like like this:

```html
<!--#if expr="$HTTP_COOKIE=/fullcss\=true/" -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/stylesheets/style.css">
<!--#else-->
  <style>
     /* critical path CSS styles go here... */
  </style>
<!--#endif-->
  <noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/stylesheets/style.css"></noscript>
```

The `#if` and `#else` conditionals are SSI directives used by Apache to do some neat things. In this context they determine if a cookie named `fullcss` has been set. If it has, cached CSS files will load using a standard `<link>` element. If it hasn't, the inline CSS will be rendered by the browser instead.

*[SSI]: Server Side Includes

For first time visitors:

1. Critical CSS inlined within the `<style>` element will load almost instantly.
2. **loadCSS** script will asynchronously load the remaining page CSS as not to block rendering.
3. A cookie will be set to trigger the loading of cached CSS on future page loads.

After setting all this up and testing my pages against [**WebPagetest**](https://www.webpagetest.org/), [**PageSpeed Insights**](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), and [**GTmetrix**](https://gtmetrix.com/) I saw an obvious drop in scrores :confused:. Apparently the SSI directives weren't working as intended, causing `style.css` to render block each page load. Hmmmm...

:bulb: Oh right, maybe it's Cloudflare's **Auto Minifying** setting mucking around! Sure enough, as soon I disabled their HTML minifier, lines like `<!--#if expr="$HTTP_COOKIE=/fullcss\=true/" -->` remained untouched. Unfortunately `style.css` was still render blocking the page.

Dug a little deeper and discovered you have to configure your server to [permit SSI](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html#configuring) before they'll be recognized. Oops! Dropped these two lines in my `.htaccess` file and everything magically worked.
