Playing with the new **Depth Effect** (aka [*fauxkeh*](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fauxkeh/)) on my iPhone 7 Plus got me thinking about Gaussian blurs, and how to improve their use on this site.

In this [last redesign](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/11.0.0), I applied a blurred effect to images in a few key locations[^locations]. To keep page speed in check I shrunk images down to `~20px` wide, optimized them with [**imagemin**](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin), and then scaled them up with `background-size: cover` to fill their parent containers.

The browser does the rest, enlarging and smoothing out these tiny images --- creating a blurred effect of sorts. For the most part they look good. On devices that display `@2x` or higher, blotchy patterns and artifacts begin to show their ugly faces.

{% endfigure %}

This is where [CSS filter functions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/) like `blur` come into play. By adding a single line to my stylesheet I was able to smoothen out these images just enough to overcome the ugly.

```diff
.teaser__bg {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
+ filter: blur(15px);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

{% figure caption:"Smoothed things out nicely with `filter: blur()`." %}

{% endfigure %}

The best part, browser [support for CSS filter effects](http://caniuse.com/#search=filter) is quite good.
