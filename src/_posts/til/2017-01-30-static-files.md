While investigating ways of using static files with Jekyll for a site prototype I was building, I learned that `site.static_files` was a thing. What is it and why you should care? Let me take a minute to share...

According to the official [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/static-files/), "a static file is a file that does not contain any YAML front matter. These include images, PDFs, and other un-rendered content."

**The useful bit** --- every one of these static files becomes accessible to Jekyll when looping through `site.static_files`. There aren't many reasons why you'd want to do this, but if building "plugin-free" image galleries is one of them --- here's how.

{% include toc.html %}

## Organize Static Files

Let's say you have a folder (named `gallery-1`) of images you want to display together on a post or page.

```
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── gallery-1/
│           ├── foo.jpg
│           ├── bar.gif
│           └── yaz.png
```

## Start a Loop

Using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)[^liquid] you'd start by looping through `site.static_files` and then narrow down the files based on their paths. In this case we only want to show those images that live together in `assets/images/gallery-1`.

[^liquid]: Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby.

```liquid
{% raw%}{% for image in site.static_files %}
  {% if image.path contains 'assets/images/gallery-1' %}
    <img src="{{ image.path }}" alt="">
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

Which will generate into the following HTML:

```html
<img src="assets/images/gallery-1/bar.gif" alt="">
<img src="assets/images/gallery-1/foo.jpg" alt="">
<img src="assets/images/gallery-1/yaz.png" alt="">
```

## Build an Image Gallery with Liquid

What if you'd rather spit out a group of thumbnail[^thumbnail] images that link to a full-size version? Completely achievable using the above method --- if you are careful to name these files in a predictable way.

[^thumbnail]: Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures, used to help in recognizing and organizing them, serving the same role for images as a normal text index does for words. 

Start by creating thumbnail versions of each image however you'd like. The important part here is to be consistent with the naming of these files. For the sake of this example I'll be adding the suffix `-th` to each filename and storing them in the same location as the full-size assets.

```
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── gallery-1/
│           ├── foo.jpg
│           ├── foo-th.jpg
│           ├── bar.gif
│           ├── bar-th.gif
│           ├── yaz.png
│           └── yaz-th.png
```

Assuming a thumbnail and full-size image share the same base name, we can construct the gallery's HTML with the following:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% for image in site.static_files %}
  {% if image.path contains 'assets/images/gallery-1' %}
    {% unless image.path contains '-th.' %}
      <a href="{{ image.path }}">
        <img src="{{ image.basename | append: '-th' | append: image.extname }}" alt="">
      </a>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

Now you may be wondering where `basename` and `extname` came from... simple. Each static file contains metadata accessible via Liquid with the following variables:

| Variable             | Description |
| --------             | ----------- |
| `file.path`          | The relative path to the file, e.g. `/assets/img/image.jpg` |
| `file.modified_time` | The time the file was last modified, e.g. `2016-04-01 16:35:26 +0200` |
| `file.name`          | The string name of the file e.g. `image.jpg` for `image.jpg` |
| `file.basename`      | The string basename of the file e.g. `image` for `image.jpg` |
| `file.extname`       | The extension name for the file, e.g. `.jpg` for `image.jpg` |

{% include notice type="warning" content="
#### Note: Filename Consistency is Paramount

Using this method to build a gallery of thumbnail images is fragile. The `image` objects inside of these loops are not validated by Jekyll at all. If you call in paths that don't exist it will silently fail and leave you with missing images on the page."
%}

## Feedback and Improvements

In the end looping through `site.static_files` became an easy way spitting out a folder of files without having to hard code `<img>` elements.  Sure there are a million different ways to do this with Jekyll, but this served a need and was a quick hack.

Curious if others are using **static files** in cool and interesting ways. Feel free to let me know in the comment section below if you are :smile:.
