Tiny portrait of Greedo from **Star Wars**. Painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5\" x 1.5\". Patience is one thing I struggle with when painting so small. Trying to rush things along really screwed me in a few places. That and leaving too much water on my brush...
