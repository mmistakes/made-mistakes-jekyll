PaperFaces portrait of [@technacity](https://twitter.com/technacity). Drawing clouds and waves is actually quite easy when using Paper for iOS's pencil and watercolor brush. I like to lay down a few wash layers with a color that makes up a majority of the sky or water. Then using white I quickly and lightly brush in the clouds and wave foam. To finish I went along the edges with a white pencil and lightly defined the clouds and splashes.
