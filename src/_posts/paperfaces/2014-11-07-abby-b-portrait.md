PaperFaces portrait of Abby B. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/yCCAgH).

It's been a while since I last drew a faceless portrait, so I decided to go back to my roots with this one.

The original drawing is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/751119/remixes) if you want a closer look or to riff off of.
