While browsing through Mix looking for inspiration I came across a drawing shared by [赵 志欣](https://mix.fiftythree.com/122266--) of Heath Ledger from **The Dark Knight**.

I gave it a star to bookmark it for later, and then during the holiday weekend I got around to enhancing it some. I started by reworking the placement and proportions of the face and hand using an image of the Joker from one of the film's posters.

Using a soft and more loose approach, I painted with white to pull out highlights from the darker background. Followed by painting blue tones over the entire canvas to mimic the colors found in the poster. As always I finished up with pencil strokes to sharpen edges and correct any paint strokes that might have bleed more than I liked.

The original illustration is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/1110713) for your remixing pleasure.
