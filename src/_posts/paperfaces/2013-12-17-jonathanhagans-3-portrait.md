Not sure if I'm going to stick with the faces or not. Part of me thinks photo-realism is overrated and there's more of a challenge in omitting details rather than drawing them all in.

But at the same time it has been fun approaching these portraits in a new way to avoid repeating myself. Working with the pencil tool and shading before applying watercolors gives the illustrations a different feel that I'm digging at the moment.
