Well it's been exactly two years since I started the [PaperFaces Project](/paperfaces/). Thought it would be interesting to draw [my wife](https://twitter.com/veganwendy) again to see how much my skills had improved over the course of the project.

It wasn't the most difficult photograph to recreate in Paper, seeing how the face is obscured and all that. But you can certainly see a change in technique and accuracy between the two.
