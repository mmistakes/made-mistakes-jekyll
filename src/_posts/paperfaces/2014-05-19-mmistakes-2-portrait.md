The last time I drew a [self portrait]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-29-michael-rose-beard-portrait %}) I didn't have a face.

I thought it would be fun to take a minute from drawing strangers and work on something more familiar. Especially since the beard is no more and my [about page](/about/) could use a refresh.
