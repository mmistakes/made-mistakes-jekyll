PaperFaces portrait of Remi L. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/wIZBLC).

I started this drawing on a 3rd generation iPad with retina screen and finished it on the new iPad Air 2. The Air 2 feels so much more comfortable during long drawing sessions compared to the heavy brick that was the iPad 3.

The original drawing is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/513427) if you want a closer look or to riff off of.
