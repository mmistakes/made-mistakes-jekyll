PaperFaces portrait of [@syropian](http://twitter.com/syropian). Felt like pushing myself to draw a full face so I dove in with just a pencil and watercolor brush. Had to adjust the color often to get lighter tones since I didn't have a working pressure sensitive stylus at my disposal. I forgot how quick using a pen like the Pogo Connect can be when shading compared to a normal capacitive stylus.
