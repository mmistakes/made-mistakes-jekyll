PaperFaces portrait of Danya W. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/NjZR3H).

Lately I've been drawn to images of figures partially obscured by shadow. I find it easier to work them into a composition that covers the entirety of Paper's digital canvas.

The original illustration is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/799752/remixes) if you want to rework it or get a closer look.
