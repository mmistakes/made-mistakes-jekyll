PaperFaces portrait of my twin girls Everly and Chloe (hiding in the bokeh).

In keeping with my recent "time lapse kick," here's a video showing the creation of this drawing from start to finish. Instead of using the built-in time lapse feature of the iPhone's camera, I gave [**Lapse It**](http://www.lapseit.com/) by Interactive Universe a try.

Found that Lapse It offers way more customization than iOS's Camera app or [Hyperlapse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8) allowing for greater control over the final render. Around a minute seems like a good length for these sorts of things since anything longer tends to get boring...

I've also shared an [in-process sketch](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/2323353) and the [finished illustration](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/2334429) on Mix.
