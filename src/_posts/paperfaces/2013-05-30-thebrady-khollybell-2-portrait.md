PaperFaces portrait of project donators [@theBrady](https://twitter.com/theBrady) and [@khollybell](https://twitter.com/khollybell).

Broke in a [Pogo Connect stylus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K448L4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009K448L4&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20) drawing this illustration and so far really enjoy it. There are some hinky issues with it losing connection or freezing up Paper for iOS, but for the most part it works flawlessly. Being able to control the thickness of watercolor strokes is a major plus, as is the dedicated undo button[^1].

[^1]: Those of you who have problems with or hate the rewind gesture will love the Pogo Connect. Just push the button on the stylus and it undos your most recent marks.
