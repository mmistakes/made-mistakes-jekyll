With the recent Star Wars Episode VII casting news and *May the 4th* nearly upon us, I decided to kickoff the week with SW inspired drawings. I'm planning on recreating scenes and characters from all of the movies each night using Paper by 53 as per usual.

Last year I stuck to the original trilogy with my [Darth Vader]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-04-darth-vader-portrait %}), [Boba Fett]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-04-boba-fett-portrait %}), [Luke]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-04-yoda-luke-skywalker-portrait %}), [Leia]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-04-slave-leia-jabba-the-hutt-portrait %}), and [Chewbacca]({% post_url /paperfaces/2013-05-04-chewbacca-leia-boob-portrait %}) portraits. This year I'm planning on mixing in a few faces from the prequels to cover the whole spectrum of films.
