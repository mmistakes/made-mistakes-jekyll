PaperFaces portrait of [@luxepain](https://twitter.com/luxepain). Always looking to further perfect my hair drawing skills --- boy was there a bunch of hair for me to practice on in this sketch! I'm including a few work in progress screen grabs below showing how I built up the hair with pencil line after pencil line after pencil line.
