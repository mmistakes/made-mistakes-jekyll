PaperFaces portrait of [@jinthagerman](https://twitter.com/jinthagerman). Landscapes are more forgiving, I think that's why I spend time drawing them over facial features.

And just so it's recorded, this is the illustration I was working on when my [Pogo Connect Smart Pen]({% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) died. Was trying to paint a large continous tone to define the mountains and instead was left with choppy marks. Examined the Pogo's tip and noticed a metal contact that should be attached to the internal circuit board was instead stuck to the magnetic tip. Bummer.
