I don't often draw faces, but with the right photo reference I sometimes attempt it. 

To build up values in the faces I used the pencil tool exclusively --- adding shadows and shading before applying watercolor. Usually I do the opposite by applying a watercolor base first and then penciling over to refine. Quite happy with how everything turned out.
