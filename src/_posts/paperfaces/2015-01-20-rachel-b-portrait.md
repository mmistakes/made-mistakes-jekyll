PaperFaces portrait of Rachel B. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/Ptkxs).

Knowing when to stop and leave well enough alone is something I wrestle with every time I draw. The in-between draws tend to be more interesting than the finished piece just because all of the blanks have been filled in. Something I need to remember for next time.

As always, I've shared the original illustration [on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/1795397) for closer examination and remixing.
