With the release of the new Steve Jobs biopic starring Ashton Kutcher --- I was inspired to recreate the movie poster with Paper by 53. Instead of using my go to combo of watercolor and pencil, I ventured out of my comfort zone using the pens exclusively. And for giggles I added the old rainbow Apple logo and *Think Different* ad campaign headline to play off the illustration's over saturated palette. 

Maybe Apple should bring back this logo, it would feel right at home with iOS 7 wouldn't it?
