PaperFaces portrait of [@edwinvdbogert](http://twitter.com/edwinvdbogert). A replacement [Pogo Connect Smart Pen]({% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) arrived just in time for me to complete this drawing with a degree of realism I wouldn't have been able to without it. Thank's *Ten One Design* for taking care of my defective Pogo Connect so fast!
