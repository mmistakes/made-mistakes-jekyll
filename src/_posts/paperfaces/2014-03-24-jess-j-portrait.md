The mouth was such a struggle for me on this one --- I suppose that's what I get for working small.

Unfortunately the pencil tool doesn't scale in size when zoomed in like the ink tools, so it was impossible to do fine line detail work. Instead of wasting a few more hours on it I just went old school *faceless* and called it a night.
