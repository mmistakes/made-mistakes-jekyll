I found a small gem of an application called iCloud Control Panel for Windows which enables me to keep my bookmarks synchronized between Safari in OS X and Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome in Windows. It also syncs bookmarks between my iOS devices, like my iPhone. It can also synchronize to Android by using Chromes internal Android synchronization. Setup is very easy:

1. Setup an iCloud account
2. Setup Safari on OS X to use iCloud bookmarks
3. Download and install [iCloud Control Panel](https://support.apple.com/da-dk/HT204283) for Windows
4. Install iCloud bookmarks plugins for the browsers you use on Windows and let it merge your bookmarks (if you want)

If you want to synchronize with Android and you use Chrome, you can use Chromes built-in bookmarks synchronization in addition to this.
