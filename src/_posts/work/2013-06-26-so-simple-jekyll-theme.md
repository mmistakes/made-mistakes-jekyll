After having so much fun creating and releasing [my first open source Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), I figured I'd go at it again. So here be the fruit of that effort --- I call it [**So Simple Theme**](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme), a responsive Jekyll theme for words and photos. 

## Features

* Responsive layouts. Looks good on mobile, tablets, and desktop devices.
* Full compatibility with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations. 
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Optional Disqus comments.
* Tags for [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) for a better social sharing experience.
* Search script.
* Support for Pygments and Coderay syntax highlighting to make your code examples look snazzy.
* Grunt tasks for easier site development.
