[*The Diving Bell and The Butterfly*](http://www.thedivingbellandthebutterfly-themovie.com/), gave me a good idea of what the world would look and sound like if I was paralyzed and only had vision in my left eye. Even though it was a sad world it was a beautiful one. Blurred, skewed, captivating and perfect.
