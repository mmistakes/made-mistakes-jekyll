In the months after ditching Disqus for a [static-based commenting system]({% post_url /articles/2016-08-21-jekyll-static-comments %}), [**Staticman**](https://staticman.net/) has matured with feature adds like *threaded comments* and *email notifications*.

Armed with instructions provided by Eduardo Bou√ßas in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/42 "Email notification upon replies"), I set off to level-up the commenting experience on **Made Mistakes**. Here's how I did it.

## Upgrade to Staticman v2

To take advantage of the new features, it was necessary to migrate Staticman settings from Jekyll's `_config.yml` file into a new `staticman.yml` file[^staticman-yml]. None of the parameter names changed making the transition to `v2` that much easier.

[^staticman-yml]: An added benefit of the new configuration file means you can use Staticman with other static site generators. `v2` no longer requires you to use a Jekyll specific `_config.yml` file.

```yaml
comments:
  allowedFields     : ['name', 'email', 'url', 'message']
  branch            : "master"
  commitMessage     : "New comment."
  filename          : "comment-{@timestamp}"
  format            : "yaml"
  moderation        : true
  path              : "src/_data/comments/{options.slug}"
  requiredFields    : ['name', 'email', 'message']
  transforms:
    email           : md5
  generatedFields:
    date:
      type          : "date"
      options:
        format      : "iso8601"
```

{% notice %}
#### New configuration options

Be sure to check the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/blob/master/staticman.sample.yml) and [full list of parameters](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration) for setup ideas.

For example you can configure multiple properties (comments, reviews, and other types of user-generated content), change commit message and request body text, enable email notifications, and much more from a `staticman.yml` file.
{% endnotice %}

### Remove/add Staticman as a collaborator

I'm not entirely sure if doing the following was necessary. I encountered errors when submitting test comments and this appeared to solve the problem. It's possible I mis-configured something else and that was the real issue...

Either way, let me know about your experience upgrading from Staticman `v1` to `v2` in the comments below.

1. Revoked collaboration rights for Staticman `v1` by removing from my GitHub repository.
   ![Remove staticmanapp as a collaborator](/assets/images/staticman-remove-collaborator.png)
2. Added Staticman back as [collaborator]({% post_url /articles/2016-08-21-jekyll-static-comments %}#setting-up-staticman).
3. Pinged the version 2 endpoint `https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/{your GitHub username}/{your repository name}` to accept the collaboration invitation.

### Update POST endpoint in comment form

To `POST` correctly to Staticman, the `action` attribute in my comment form needed a small update. Changing `v1` to `v2` in [**_includes/page__comments.html**](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/f0074b7b9e64b6d4b63dd13a371cedc576dae49d/src/_includes/page__comments.html#L34) and appending `/comments`[^property] to the end did the trick for me.

```html
{% raw %}<form id="comment-form" class="page__form js-form form" method="post" action="https://api.staticman.net/v2/entry/{{ site.repository }}/{{ site.staticman.branch }}/comments">{% endraw %}
```

[^property]: Site properties are optional. See Staticman documentation for details on [hooking up your forms](https://staticman.net/docs/#step-3-hook-up-your-forms).

## Add support for threaded comments

Getting nested comments working was a big pain point for me. Numerous Liquid errors, trying to wrap my head around `for` loops inside of other `for` loops, array filters that broke things, and more --- took me a bit to figure out.

### Add "replying to" identifier

To properly nest replies I needed a way of determining their hierarchy. I went with a field named `replying_to` and added it as an `allowedField` to my Staticman config file:

```yaml
allowedFields: ["name", "email", "url", "message", "replying_to"]
```

And to my comment form as a hidden field:

```html
<input type="hidden" id="comment-parent" name="fields[replying_to]" value="">
```

{% notice %}
#### Update: field name change

After publishing this article I learned that [`options[parent]`](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/42#issuecomment-262938831) is meant to identify subscription entries, and not comment lineage. I've since changed to `fields[replying_to]` and updated the article and sample code to reflect this.
{% endnotice %}

### Update Liquid loops

To avoid displaying duplicates, I needed to exclude replies and only top level comments in the main loop. This seemed like the perfect use-case for Jekyll's `where_exp` filter:

{% notice %}
#### Where expression Jekyll filter

Select all the objects in an array where the expression is true. Jekyll v3.2.0 & later. **Example:** `site.members | where_exp: "item", "item.graduation_year == 2014"`
{% endnotice %}

If the hidden `fields[replying_to]` field I added to the form was working properly I should have comment data files similar to these:

#### Parent comment example

```yaml
message: This is parent comment message.
name: First LastName
email: md5g1bb3r15h
date: '2016-11-30T22:03:15.286Z'
```

#### Child comment example

```yaml
message: This is a child comment message.
name: First LastName
email: md5g1bb3r15h
replying_to: '7'
date: '2016-11-02T05:08:43.280Z'
```

As you can see above, the "child" comment has `replying_to` data populated from the hidden `fields[replying_to]` field in the form. Using this knowledge I tested against it using `where_exp:"comment", "comment.replying_to == blank"` to create an array of only "top-level" comments.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign comments = site.data.comments[page.slug] | sort | where_exp: "comment", "comment[1].replying_to == blank" %}
{% for comment in comments %}
  {% assign avatar      = comment[1].avatar %}
  {% assign email       = comment[1].email %}
  {% assign name        = comment[1].name %}
  {% assign url         = comment[1].url %}
  {% assign date        = comment[1].date %}
  {% assign message     = comment[1].message %}
  {% include comment.html avatar=avatar email=email name=name url=url date=date message=message %}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

{% figure caption:"Success, there be parent comments Captain!" %}
![Parent comments only](/assets/images/staticman-parent-comments-only.png)
{% endfigure %}

{% notice %}
#### Note: `sort` and `where` filters don't mix

I ran into strange behaviors and errors due to mixing a `sort` filter with `where` and `where_exp`. Came to the conclusion it was unnecessary as the items were already being sorted alphabetically based on their filenames, and removed the filter.

I'm using the following: `filename: \"comment-{@timestamp}\"` structure. Your mileage may vary depending on how you name entries.
{% endnotice %}

{% notice %}
#### Note: added back `sort` filter

Not exactly sure if it's a filesystem or OS thing, but building my site with Travis CI shuffled the order of comments. Applying `sort` to the `comments` assign was necessary to get everything in the correct chronological order.
{% endnotice %}

#### Displaying nested comments

Here is what I was looking to accomplish... before the headaches started :anguished: :gun:

- Start a loop and on each iteration create a new array named `replies` of only reply comments.
- Evaluate the value of `replying_to` in these replies.
- If `replying_to` is equal to the index of the parent loop then it's a child and should be treated as one.
- If not, move on to the next entry in the array.
- Rinse and repeat.

I determined the easiest way of assigning a unique identifier to each parent comment would be sequentially. Thankfully Liquid provides a way of doing this with `forloop.index`.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign index = forloop.index %}{% endraw %}
```

{% notice %}
#### Universally unique identifier

I realize an index based unique identifier isn't the smartest way to go about this. I have a mix of comment data migrated from Disqus and pre Staticman generating UUIDs as `_id` variables, so this made sense. YMMV.
{% endnotice %}

*[YMMV]: Your mileage may vary

Next I nested a modified copy of the "top-level comment" loop from before inside of itself --- to function as the "child" or `replies` loop.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% capture i %}{{ include.index }}{% endcapture %}
{% assign replies = site.data.comments[page.slug] | sort | where_exp: "comment", "comment[1].replying_to == i" %}
{% for reply in replies %}
  {% assign index       = forloop.index | prepend: '-' | prepend: include.index %}
  {% assign replying_to = reply[1].replying_to %}
  {% assign avatar      = reply[1].avatar %}
  {% assign email       = reply[1].email %}
  {% assign name        = reply[1].name %}
  {% assign url         = reply[1].url %}
  {% assign date        = reply[1].date %}
  {% assign message     = reply[1].message %}
  {% include comment.html index=index replying_to=replying_to avatar=avatar email=email name=name url=url date=date message=message %}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

Unfortunately the `where_exp` filter proved troublesome yet again, causing Jekyll to error out with: `Liquid Exception: Liquid error (line 47): Nesting too deep in /_layouts/page.html`.

After brief thoughts of the movie **Inception**, I applied an `inspect` filter to help troubleshoot the `replies` loop. I determined that the `where_exp` condition was failing[^integer-string] because I was trying to compare an integer against a string :flushed:.

[^integer-string]: `15` is not the same as `'15'`. Those single quotes make a world of difference...

To solve this I placed a `capture` tag around the index variable to convert it from an integer into a string. Then modified the `where_exp` condition to compare `replying_to` against this new `{% raw %}{{ i }}{% endraw %}` variable --- fixing the issue and allowing me to move on.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% capture i %}{{ include.index }}{% endcapture %}
{% assign replies = site.data.comments[page.slug] | where_exp:"item", "item.replying_to == i" %}{% endraw %}
```

#### `_includes/page__comments.html`

### Comment reply HTML and JavaScript

Next up was to add some finishing touches to pull everything together.

Familiar with the way [**Wordpress**](https://wordpress.org/) handles reply forms I looked to it for inspiration. Digging through the JavaScript in [`wp-includes/js/comment-reply.js`](https://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/wp-includes/js/comment-reply.js) I found everything I could possibly need:

- `respond` function to move form into view
- `cancel` function to destroy a reply form a return it to its original state
- pass parent's unique identifier to `fields[replying_to]` on form submit

To start I used an `unless` condition to only show reply links on "top-level" comments. I only planned on going one-level deep with replies, so this seemed like a good way of enforcing that.

```html
{% raw %}{% unless r %}
  <div class="comment__reply">
    <a rel="nofollow" class="btn" href="#comment-{{ include.index }}">Reply to {{ include.name }}</a>
  </div>
{% endunless %}{% endraw %}
```

{% figure caption:"Nested comments one-level deep." %}
![Nested comments](/assets/images/staticman-nested-comments.png)
{% endfigure %}

To give the **reply link** life I added the following `onclick` attribute and [JavaScript](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/49632d19977e341b51c91dad8e71bf6ef88e79c3/src/assets/javascripts/main.js#L84-L181) to it.

```javascript
{% raw %}onclick="return addComment.moveForm('comment-{{ include.index }}', '{{ include.index }}', 'respond', '{{ page.slug }}')"{% endraw %}
```

A few minor variable name changes to Wordpress' `comment-reply.js` script was all it took to get everything working with my `form` markup.

{% figure caption:"Hitting a **reply button** moves the comment form into view and populates `<input type='hidden' id='comment-replying-to' name='fields[replying_to]' value=''>` with the correct *parent* `value`. While tapping **Cancel reply** returns the input to its original state of `null`." %}
![Comment replies in action](/assets/images/comment-reply-animation.gif)
{% endfigure %}

## Add support for email notifications

Compared to nesting comment replies, email notifications were a breeze to setup.

### Update `staticman.yml` configuration

To ensure that links in notification emails are safe and only come from trusted domains, set `allowedOrigins` accordingly. 

**Example:**

```yaml
allowedOrigins: ["mademistakes.com"]
```

The domain(s) allowed here must match those passed from an `options.origin` field we're going to add in the next step. Only domains that match will trigger notifications to send, otherwise the operation will abort.

{% notice %}
#### ProTip: use your own Mailgun account

The public instance of Staticman uses a [**Mailgun**](http://www.mailgun.com/) account with a limit of 10,000 emails a month. You are encouraged to create an account and add your own [Mailgun API and domain](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration#notifications.enabled) to `staticman.yml`. Be sure you encrypt both using the following endpoint: `https://api.staticman.net/v2/encrypt/{TEXT TO BE ENCRYPTED}`.
{% endnotice %}

### Update comment form

To finish, add the following three fields to the comment `form`. 

**Field 1 + 2:** Hidden input fields that pass the `origin`[^origin] set in `staticman.yml` and unique identifier to the entry the user is subscriber to:

```html
{% raw %}<input type="hidden" name="options[origin]" value="{{ page.url | absolute_url }}">
<input type="hidden" name="options[parent]" value="{{ page.url | absolute_url }}">{% endraw %}
```

**Field 3:** A checkbox `input` for subscribing to email notifications.

```html  
<label for="comment-form-reply">
  <input type="checkbox" id="comment-form-reply" name="options[subscribe]" value="email">
  Notify me of new comments by email.
</label>
```

Nothing fancy here, `name=options[subscribe]` and `value="email"` are added to the field to associate subscription data with email address.

[^origin]: This URL will be included in the notification email sent to subscribers, allowing them to open the page directly.

If setup correctly a user should receive an email anytime a new comment on the post or page they subscribed to is merged in.

Well there you have it, a static-based commenting system done up in Jekyll that handles nested comments and reply notifications. Now if I could only shave a minute of my build time to get new comments merged in quicker :frowning:.
