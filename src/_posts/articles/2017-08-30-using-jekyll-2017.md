Not going to lie --- I :heart: [Jekyll](/tag/jekyll/), but huge static sites like mine take forever to build. What used to take seconds now go on for over 30 minutes, as thousands of files are generated and optimized.

Inspired by Anne Tomasevich's post, [**Optimizing Jekyll Performance with Gulp**](http://savaslabs.com/2016/10/19/optimizing-jekyll-with-gulp.html) --- I begun digging into my build process to identify performance bottlenecks.

At the time of writing this post, my site contained roughly:

- 1,028 images generated at different sizes (5,140 in total).
- 1,052 total documents ([991 posts](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/src/_posts) / [14 pages](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/src/_pages) / 3 sets of collections).
- [535 comments](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/src/_data/comments) stored as YAML data files.

And was built with the following Jekyll plugins: [jekyll-picture-tag][jekyll-picture-tag], [sort_name][sort_name], [jekyll-archives][jekyll-archives], [jekyll-assets][jekyll-assets], [jekyll/tagging][jekyll/tagging], [jekyll-tagging-related_posts][jekyll-tagging-related_posts], [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap], [jemoji][jemoji], [jekyll-category-post-navigation][jekyll-category-post-navigation], and [jekyll-typogrify][jekyll-typogrify].

Using Jekyll's profiler flag `--profile`, I measured how long the following tasks took to complete[^3-trials]. Before each build I ran `jekyll clean` to wipe `_site`, `.asset-cache` and any other temporary files to keep results more consistent. 

[^3-trials]: Each task was run 3 times and averaged as the values produced by `jekyll build --profile` varied quite a bit.

| Task description | Windows | Mac |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Generate responsively sized `page.image.feature` images | 1288.29s | 1429.26s |
| Minify HTML with `layout: compress` | 39.35s | 11.18s |
| Read `/images/` and copy to `_site/` | 32.39s | 23.63s |
| Build tag pages with jekyll-archives | 17.40s | 9.99s |

| List related posts with [jekyll-tagging-related_posts][jekyll-tagging-related_posts], [jekyll/tagging][jekyll/tagging], and `LSI: true` | 38.36s | 17.87s |
| List related posts with vanilla `related_posts` | 1.65s | 4.90s |

#### Is Jekyll faster on macOS or Windows?

For giggles I also tested my Windows and Mac development environments against each other. While not exactly an apples to apples comparison I thought it would be interesting to note any variations.

| Windows Environment | Mac Environment |
| --- | --- |
| Lenovo ThinkStation E30 | iMac 21.5-inch, Late 2013 |
| Processor 3.30 GHz Intel Xeon E31245 | Processor 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 |
| Memory 16 GB | Memory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 |
| Intel SSDSA2BW160G3L 137GB | 1.12 TB Fusion Drive |
| Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 | OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 |
| ruby 2.2.4p230 [x64-mingw32] | ruby 2.1.0p0 (2013-12-25 revision 44422) [x86_64-darwin12.0] |"
%}

## Optimization

The numbers above don't lie. Relying on Jekyll and friends to do jobs more suited for a task runner like [**Gulp**][gulpjs] was slowing the build. Armed with this knowledge I started stripping down Jekyll to one of its core purposes --- *converting Markdown files into HTML*.

Doing this also allowed me to make my site's content more portable and not as reliant on a specific static-site generator. In the off-chance I wanted to swap Jekyll for another SSG like [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) or [**Gatsby**](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), I could.

*[SSG]: Static-site generator

### CSS and JavaScript Assets

[**Jekyll Assets**][jekyll-assets] is a great plugin that served me well for a long time by: preprocessing, vendor prefixing, concatenating, minifying, and fingerprinting assets. But with a site of my size it was painfully slow to iterate with during front-end development.

Making a change to a Sass partial would trigger a full site rebuild, which meant waiting a few minutes before it could be previewed in a browser. Jekyll's incremental build feature might have helped here, but I never had much luck getting it to work reliably.

During development CSS or JavaScript changes would ideally be pushed instantly to the browser with something like [Browsersync][browsersync]. By replacing [Jekyll Assets][jekyll-assets] with the following Gulp alternatives I was able to do this, and improve build times by 93%:

- [**node-sass**][node-sass] and [**gulp-sass**][gulp-sass]: natively compile SCSS files to CSS.
- [**gulp-autoprefixer**][gulp-autoprefixer]: vendor prefix CSS.
- [**gulp-cssnano**][gulp-cssnano]: minify CSS.
- [**gulp-concat**][gulp-concat]: concatenate JavaScript.
- [**gulp-uglify**][gulp-uglify]: minify JavaScript with [UglifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyjs).
- [**gulp-sourcemaps**][gulp-sourcemaps]: add source maps for CSS and JS.
- [**gulp-gzip**][gulp-gzip]: gzip CSS and JS.
- [**gulp-rev**][gulp-rev]: append hash to CSS and JS filenames for cache busting.

*[SCSS]: Sassy CSS

| Task description | Jekyll Assets | Gulp |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| CSS and JavaScript asset pipeline | 25.031s | 1.577s |

Here's a small taste of the [Gulp file](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/gulp/tasks/assets.js) I'm using for the site's styles if you're curious:

```javascript
// 'gulp styles' -- creates a CSS file from SCSS, adds prefixes and creates a Sourcemap
// 'gulp styles --prod' -- creates a CSS file from your SCSS, adds prefixes,
//   minifies, and cache busts it (does not create a Sourcemap)
gulp.task('styles', () => {
  return gulp.src([paths.sassFiles + '/main.scss'])
    .pipe(when(!argv.prod, sourcemaps.init()))
    // preprocess Sass
    .pipe(sass({precision: 10}).on('error', sass.logError))
    .pipe(postcss([
      // add vendor prefixes
      autoprefixer({
        browsers: [
          'last 2 versions',
          '> 5%',
          'IE 9'
        ]
      })
    ]))
    // minify for production
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, when('*.css', cssnano({autoprefixer: false}))))
    .pipe(size({showFiles: true}))
    // output sourcemap for development
    .pipe(when(!argv.prod, sourcemaps.write('.')))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gulp.dest(paths.sassFilesTemp)))
    // hash CSS for production
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, rev()))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({showFiles: true})))
    // output hashed files
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.sassFilesTemp))
    // generate manifest of hashed CSS files
    .pipe(rev.manifest('css-manifest.json'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.tempDir + paths.sourceDir + paths.dataFolderName))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({showFiles: true})))
    .pipe(when(!argv.prod, browserSync.stream()))
});

// function to properly reload your browser
function reload(done) {
  browserSync.reload();
  done();
}

// 'gulp serve' -- open site in browser and watch for changes
//   in source files and update them when needed
gulp.task('serve', (done) => {
  browserSync.init({
    // tunnel: true,
    // open: false,
    port: 4000, // change port to match default Jekyll
    ui: {
      port: 4001
    },
    server: [paths.tempFolderName, paths.siteFolderName]
  });
  done();

  // watch various files for changes
  gulp.watch(paths.sassFilesGlob, gulp.series('styles', reload));
});
```

Without going too deep into how these Gulp tasks work, the gist is:

1. A glob of files have "stuff" done to them using various plugins.
2. These files are placed in a temporary folder excluded from Jekyll so they don't trigger a full site rebuild during development.
3. Production builds move these temporary files and deploys them alongside the HTML files generated by Jekyll.

### Image Assets

Resizing a thousand or so images to serve them responsively is no joke --- taking over 20 minutes to complete in my site's case. Up until now I was using the [Jekyll Picture Tag][jekyll-picture-tag] plugin to do this work for me... which wasn't ideal.

To try and see if [Node][nodejs] and [Gulp][gulpjs] could do this faster I came up with a set of Gulp tasks to:

1. Generate thousands of "feature" images[^feature-image] at 4 different sizes with [**gulp-responsive**](https://github.com/mahnunchik/gulp-responsive).
2. Optimize all images using [**gulp-imagemin**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin).
3. Save the optimized images directly to the destination folder --- bypassing Jekyll and a full-site rebuild.

[^feature-image]: I classify "features" as large, often full-width images commonly seen in landing pages built with **Bootstrap** and other popular CSS frameworks.

This helped some, but it wasn't until I [dropped GraphicsMagick](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/commit/56bbd9bf5429a269047a41e045cc2ef0bf34e62b) for [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)[^sharp-gif] did I see a noticeable improvement...

[^sharp-gif]: Sharp is super fast, but only resizes JPEG, PNG, WebP, and TIFF images... no GIF. It's also a pain in the ass to install on Windows due to the [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) dependency.

{% include notice type="info" content="
#### Sharp Really is as Fast as they Say

I shaved 18 minutes off my build time using this high speed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module!

| Task description | GraphicsMagick | Sharp |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Resize and optimize 1,014 source images into 5 target sizes | 1288.29s | 171.00s |"
%}

The other missing piece was generating the necessary markup for responsive images[^rwd-images]. Because I was no longer using the `{% raw %}{% picture %}{% endraw %}` tag to output a fully formed [`<picture>` element](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/), I had to roll my own responsive image markup. 

[^rwd-images]: In the last couple of years several "cloud" solutions have emerged to make serving responsively sized images easier. [**Cloudinary**](http://cloudinary.com/) (free plan), [**imgix**](https://www.imgix.com/) (paid plans), and [**ImageEngine**](https://www.scientiamobile.com/page/imageengine) (free plan) just to name a few.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if page.image.feature %}
  {% assign f = page.image.feature | split: '.' %}
  <img src="{{ f[0] | relative_url }}-320.{{ f[1] }}"
       srcset="{{ f[0] | relative_url }}-768.{{ f[1] }} 768w,
               {{ f[0] | relative_url }}-1024.{{ f[1] }} 1024w,
               {{ f[0] | relative_url }}.{{ f[1] }} 1920w"
       alt="{{ page.title }}">
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

This bit of Liquid takes the filename as defined by `page.image.feature`, splits it at the extension, appends suffixes that match those used in the gulp-responsive task, and adds them to the `srcset` attribute. :boom: resolution switching images!

{% include notice type="warning" content="
#### Liquid Limitations

This Gulp + Liquid hybrid isn't as nice as a plugin since there is no logic to actually verify if `-lq`, `-320`, `-768`, or `-1024` versions of the images exist. I'm willing to look passed that since it did shave 16 minutes off my build time :wink:."
%}

### Simplify Layouts

With the bulk of the time savings coming from faster image resizing tasks, I went after some low-hanging fruit next by [decluttering my layouts](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/issues/81). Anything that detracted from the main content or added visual noise to the page was fair game for removal.

#### Remove Social Sharing Module

Including buttons at the bottom (or top of post) didn't really boost shares of my content on Twitter or Facebook --- so I dropped them. If someone really wants to share it on social media they'll use the built-in methods of iOS/Android or do it the old fashioned way of copy-pasting a URL.

#### Replace `layout: compress`

Occasionally things on the site would break if inline JavaScript with `//` styled comments were used. This happened because of a complex set of Liquid filters used in my [`compress` layout][compress-layout] to reduce whitespace in the generated HTML.

The fix was easy, just surround inline JavaScript comments with `/* */` instead. Or do what I did, stop using `layout: compress` and minify with these Gulp plugins instead: [**gulp-htmlmin**][gulp-htmlmin] and [**gulp-gzip**][gulp-gzip].

```javascript
// 'gulp html' -- does nothing
// 'gulp html --prod' -- minifies and gzips HTML files for production
gulp.task('html', () => {
  return gulp.src(paths.siteFolderName + paths.htmlPattern)
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, htmlmin({
      removeComments: true,
      collapseWhitespace: true,
      collapseBooleanAttributes: false,
      removeAttributeQuotes: false,
      removeRedundantAttributes: false,
      minifyJS: true,
      minifyCSS: true
    })))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({title: 'optimized HTML'})))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gulp.dest(paths.siteFolderName)))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gzip({append: true})))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({
      title: 'gzipped HTML',
      gzip: true
    })))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gulp.dest(paths.siteFolderName)))
});
```

{% include notice type="warning" content="
#### Minifying HTML with Gulp

In my tests, replacing [`_layouts/compress.html`](http://jch.penibelst.de/) with Gulp tasks to minify and gzip every HTML file ended up being slightly slower.

| Task description | compress layout | gulp-html and gulp-gzip |
| --- | | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Minify HTML files | 39.348s | 47.00s |

I'm willing to live with the extra 8 seconds of build time as it helps avoid potential site breakages due to badly minified scripts..."
%}

#### Reduce and Replace JavaScript

I'm close to ditching jQuery and going vanilla, but I'm not quite there yet. Where possible I've ditched jQuery plugins and [replaced with "lighter" alternatives](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/issues/84). Here's a few highlights:

- Replaced [**Magnific Popup**](https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup) with [**Lity**](http://sorgalla.com/lity/).
- Replaced [**Lazyload**](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload) with [**Lazysizes**](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) + [Lazysizes responsive images polyfill extension](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/tree/gh-pages/plugins/respimg).
- Added [**SVG 4 Everybody**](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) for external SVG spritemap support.
- Replaced [**FitVids.JS**](http://fitvidsjs.com/) with responsive embed CSS and a custom Jekyll [video embed tag](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_plugins/video_embed.rb).

### Results

Decoupling the asset pipeline from Jekyll and Gulp-ifying it made the biggest splash in terms of build time. Along with [Browsersync][browsersync], any asset (CSS, JavaScript, images and icons) updates could be previewed almost instantly. Greatly speeding up the time it takes to develop and iterate the site's front-end.

{% include notice type="info" content="
#### Made Mistakes Gulp files

This set of Gulp tasks were heavily inspired by those in Sondre Nilsen's [**Jekyllized Yeoman generator**](https://github.com/sondr3/generator-jekyllized). The main [`gulpfile.js`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/gulpfile.js) is broken down into [smaller bits](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/gulp/tasks): assets, build, clean, copy, html, images, and uploading.

With [`paths.js`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/gulp/paths.js) assigning all of the various paths used throughout the files to DRY things up."
%}

*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures.

## Automation/Continuous Integration

After ditching Disqus last year to [roll my own static-based solution]({% post_url /articles/2016-08-21-jekyll-static-comments %}) powered by [**Staticman**](https://staticman.net/), I needed to find a better way of deploying the site. Merging in new comments, pulling those commits down, manually building the site locally, and then deploying to my web server wasn't ideal.

With some research I determined a continuous integration[^ci] platform like **Travis CI**[^ci-platforms] that integrates with GitHub was what I needed.

![Travis CI interface screenshot](/assets/images/mm-travis-ci-screenshot.png)
{: .browser-frame}

[^ci]: Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

[^ci-platforms]: There are several CI platforms and services out there that can automate testing, building, and deploying a JAMstack site. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/), [Codeship](https://www.codeship.io/), [Travis CI][travis-ci], and [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) to name a few.

Setting things up with Travis CI wasn't too painful, but there was some trial and error getting dependencies squared away. I'd suggest reading through [their documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/), but the basic idea is:

1. [Sign in to Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/auth) with your GitHub account and grant it access.
2. Configure the build and deployment scripts with a [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/.travis.yml) file.
3. Set the type of triggers[^triggers] that initiate a build.

[^triggers]: Branch updates, pull requests, or both.

### Travis CI Config

Let's take a closer look my `.travis.yml` config file and how I've set it up.

```yaml
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.2
```

Since Jekyll is built on Ruby I set the language to `ruby`. Depending on what version of Jekyll you're using you can change `rvm` to meet your needs. I went with `2.2` since that's the latest [Travis CI provides](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/ruby/#Supported-Ruby-Versions-and-RVM).

```yaml
sudo: false
```

This enables quicker build start times using the new [container-based infrastructure](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrating-from-legacy/).

```yaml
branches:
  only:
    - master
```

Fairly obvious, build only from the `master` branch.

```yaml
cache:
  bundler: true
  yarn: true
  directories:
    - node_modules # NPM packages
```

Travis CI pulls down and installs gem and Node.js modules before every build. Depending on what you have in your `Gemfile` and `package.json` files this can take a bit of time. 

The above lines enable caching of these dependencies eliminating this installation step.

```yaml
addons:
  apt:
    sources:
      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
    packages:
      - g++-4.8

env:
  CXX=g++-4.8
```

Enables the [GCC, GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) using [APT Addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/installing-dependencies/#Installing-Packages-with-the-APT-Addon) and a newer version of `gcc/g++` to properly install [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp).

### Travis CI Build Lifecycle

My [build lifecycle](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#The-Build-Lifecycle) breaks down like this: 

1. Clone repo and any submodules. 
2. Install `apt addons`.
3. Install Ruby gems.
4. Upgrade Node.js and install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) + Node modules.
5. Run Gulp production build task `gulp build --prod`.
6. [Decrypt private SSH keys](https://oncletom.io/2016/travis-ssh-deploy/) needed to rsync files to my server.
7. Run Gulp deploy task:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     provider: script
     skip_cleanup: true
     script: gulp deploy
     on:
       branch: master
   ```

With everything configured I no longer need to build locally and deploy. I can merge in comments or make small edits to Markdown files directly on GitHub, and automatically trigger a site build/deploy.

If there's a problem Travis CI will notify me, otherwise in ~15 minutes (or however long the build takes) any changes committed will be live on the site.

{% include notice type="info" content="
#### ProTip: Use Travis CI with Sites Hosted on GitHub Pages

Travis CI comes in handy if you want to use Jekyll plugins or a more advanced Gulp workflow like I am. There are [deployment scripts](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) specifically for this purpose. 

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [GitLab](https://pages.gitlab.io/), and friends also do similar things if you're feeling constrained by what's currently allowed by GitHub Pages."

## Other Jekyll Related Bits

### Pagination Upgrades

Looking to wring a little more #WebPerf juice out of my site, I went after category and tag archive pages next. Depending on the tag, these `index.html` pages could be quite hefty due to the amount of HTML needed to display hundreds of post teasers.

To trim them down in size I needed a way of paginating these pages into small chunks. Jekyll has an [official pagination plugin](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/), but unfortunately it's limited (and deprecated) in what it can actually paginate. [**Jekyll Paginate v2**][jekyll-paginate-v2] on the other hand is fully featured, backwards compatible, and actively being worked on.

In addition to paginating posts it can handle: [collections](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#paginating-collections), [categories](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#filtering-categories), [tags](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#filtering-tags), and [locales](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#filtering-locales) (useful if you have a multi-language site).

It doesn't stop there though! It has a built-in generator called [**Auto-Pages**][auto-pages] to create tag, category, and collection archives. Which unlike [**Jekyll Archives**][jekyll-archives], can all be paginated.

With a few changes to my `_config.yml` file and adapting my Jekyll Archive [layout](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_layouts/autopage_tags.html) to work with [Jekyll Paginate v2][jekyll-paginate-v2], I was ready to roll.

```yaml
# Plugin: Pagination (jekyll-paginate-v2)
pagination:
  enabled      : true
  debug        : false
  per_page     : 15
  permalink    : "/page/:num/"
  title        : ":title - Page :num of :max"
  limit        : 0
  sort_field   : "date"
  sort_reverse : true

# Plugin: Auto Pages (jekyll-paginate-v2)
autopages:
  enabled      : true
  categories:
    enabled    : false
  collections:
    enabled    : false
  tags:
    enabled    : true
    layouts:
      - "autopage_tags.html"
    title      : ":tag" # :tag is replaced by the tag name
    permalink  : "/tag/:tag"
```

For category archives I created my own bespoke pages since there are only a handful of them. Mostly because it was easier to customize them than generating with [Auto-Pages][auto-pages].

**Step 1:** Create an archive page... let's use my [Articles archive](/articles/) as an example. I like to keep all of my source pages grouped together, so I created `articles.md` and placed it in a [folder named `_pages`]({% post_url /articles/2016-02-17-using-jekyll-2016 %}#pages-for-everything-else).

**Step 2:** Enable pagination and define what categories it should filter, in this case `articles` by adding the following YAML Front Matter to `articles.md`.

```yaml
pagination: 
  enabled: true
  category: articles
```

{% include notice type="info" content="
#### ProTip: [Filter Multiple Categories](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#filtering-categories)

Want to combine several categories into one paginator object? Jekyll Paginate v2 has you covered. Just add additional categories as a comma separated list e.g. `category: foo, bar`."
%}

**Step 3:** Output the posts by looping through the `paginator.posts` array. A simple example would look something like this:

```liquid
<ul>
  {% raw %}{% for post in paginator.posts %}
    <!-- what you want to output. title, url, image, etc. -->
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
</ul>
```

And for "next/previous" navigation links you can do something like this:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if paginator.total_pages > 1 %}
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    <a href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}">Newer Posts</a>
  {% endif %}
  {% if paginator.next_page %}

### Lazyload Tag

Another #WebPerf improvement was adding the ability to defer loading of images and video embeds.

To do this I created a custom Jekyll plugin using [**lazysizes**](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) to do some JavaScript magic.

| Attribute  | Required     | Description |
| ----       | --------     | ----------- |
| `data-src` | **Required** | Full path to image eg: `/assets/images/filename.jpg`. Use absolute URLS for those hosted externally. |
| `src`      | Optional     | Full path to low-quality image eg: `/assets/images/filename.jpg`. Use absolute URLS for those hosted externally. Defaults to inline transparent `.gif`. |
| `alt`      | Optional     | Image alternate text. |

**Example:**

```liquid
{% raw %}{% lazyload data-src="/assets/images/my-image.jpg" src="/assets/images/my-image-low-quality.jpg" alt="my lazyloaded image" %}{% endraw %}
```

A Liquid version of this method is used in the [hero image include](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/11.0.0/src/_includes/page__hero.html) to apply a nice blur effect as those large images are loaded by the browser.

### Responsive Video Embed Tag

Custom Jekyll plugin to embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo that responsively sizes to fit the width of its parent using [`/_plugins/video_embed.rb`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_plugins/video_embed.rb).

Embeds are also [lazyloaded](#lazyload-tag) to improve page performance.

#### YouTube Embed

To embed the following YouTube video at url `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFX1CUO472U` (long version) or `https://youtu.be/fFX1CUO472U` (short version) into a post or page's main content you'd use: 

```liquid
{% raw %}{% youtube fFX1CUO472U %}{% endraw %}
```

#### Vimeo Embed

To embed the following Vimeo video at url `https://vimeo.com/97649261` into a post or page's main content you'd use: 

```liquid
{% raw %}{% vimeo 34948855 %}{% endraw %}
```

### Simplified Breadcrumbs

Previously I was using some Liquid voodoo to [build a trail of breadcrumbs](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/10.3.0/src/_includes/breadcrumbs.html). This sort of worked because my site structure isn't too complex. On the other hand it wasn't flexible and didn't allow for overriding crumbs with more descriptive labels.

Since my content hierarchy is shallow I decided to manually assign breadcrumbs to each post with YAML Front Matter.

```yaml
breadcrumbs:
  - label: "Blog Articles"
    url: /articles/
```

Then using this Liquid and HTML it's outputted in my layout:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if page.breadcrumbs %}
  {% assign crumb = page.breadcrumbs[0] %}
  <a href="{{ crumb.url }}"><strong>{{ crumb.label }}</strong></a>
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
``` 

For multiple levels of breadcrumbs the following YAML and sample `for` loop should get the job started.

```yaml
breadcrumbs:
  - label: "Level 1"
    url: /level-1/
  - label: "Level 2"
    url: /level-2/
```

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if page.breadcrumbs %}
  <ul class="breadcrumbs">
    {% for crumb in page.breadcrumbs %}
      <li><a href="{{ crumb.url }}">{{ crumb.label }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include notice type="info" content="
#### ProTip: Add Breadcrumbs Using [Front Matter Defaults](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults)

Take a DRY approach and [add breadcrumbs](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/11.0.0/_config.yml#L126-L128) at the category level instead of on every post/page. `defaults:` in `_config.yml` is your friend."
%}

### Popular Tags

Looking over my site's analytics I came to the conclusion no one was clicking on the "this post was tagged" links, so I removed them. To make category pages more sticky and useful including tags seemed more useful. So with the following Liquid I was able to build a list of the most popular tags filtered on the current category.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign filterCategory = page.pagination.category | default: page.category %}

<ul>
  {% assign tagLimiter = 0 %}
  {% for tag in site.tags %}
    {% comment %}create an empty array{% endcomment %}
    {% assign postsInCategory = "" | split: "/" %}

    {% comment %}loop over site.tags{% endcomment %}
    {% for post in tag[1] %}
      {% if post.categories contains filterCategory %}
        {% comment %}if a post is in the filter category add it to postsInCategory array{% endcomment %}
        {% assign postsInCategory = postsInCategory | push: post %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

    {% comment %}poor man's tag limit on those that are frequently used{% endcomment %}
    {% if postsInCategory.size >= 5 and tagLimiter <= 5 %}
      {% assign tagLimiter = tagLimiter | plus: 1 %}
      <li><a href="/tag/{{ tag[0] | replace:' ','-' | downcase }}/" >{{ tag[0] }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
</ul>
```

On my **Mastering Paper** category page about the iPad app [Paper by FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/), you'll see related links to tags like *Paper by 53*, *iPad*, *drawing*, etc.
