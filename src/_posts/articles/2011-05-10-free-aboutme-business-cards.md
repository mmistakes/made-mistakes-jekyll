Pretty much the only reason I created an About.me page was to get free customized business cards printed by Moo.

If you weren't aware --- [About.me](http://about.me) is a custom profile and personal analytics dashboard that lets you quickly build a personal page that points users to your content from around the web. Its straightforward <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor makes customizing the design, fonts, colors, and background image a breeze.

To take advantage of the [free stack of business cards](http://about.me/offers/cards) (technically it's not free --- shipping costs $5.50), just hit up the *offers section* in your About.me dashboard to place an order. You can import all your info and design elements or start from scratch and customize everything.
