Similar to previously years, I started out with the best of intentions for [**Inktober**](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober) and then quickly lose steam...

After taking a few days to complete a single ink wash --- I was spent. Working digitally has spoiled me to the point that sitting at a desk instead of the sofa, cleaning brushes, and dealing with messes is just too much work to bother with.

I did manage to record a time lapse video during hour 2 of the painting. Unfortunately I mistakenly put the iPhone 7 Plus in **SLO-MO** mode by mistake for the first half. Really surprised there was enough free space to record an hour of 1080p video...

October is half over and I suppose there's still time for me to knock out another portrait or two. If past years are any indication there's not a good chance of that happening. :neutral_face:
