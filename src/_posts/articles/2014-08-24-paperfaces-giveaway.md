To celebrate two years of [drawing portraits every day]({% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}), I'm launching a fun giveaway leading up to the special day.

On August 31st I'll select **(3) winners** at random to draw digitally[^disclaimer] on my iPad, using portrait reference photographs of their choice. [Here's a refresher](/paperfaces/) of the type of drawing I will end up doing if you're new to my work.

[^disclaimer]: Upon the drawing's completion the winners will receive PNG files measuring 2048&times;1536 pixels. This contest is for a digital drawing only, the winners *will not* receive a physical drawing.

Entering the PaperFaces Giveaway is simple. **Contest has ended**: <s>Just fill out the Rafflecopter form below and follow the directions.</s> You can increase your odds of winner by completing some or all of the entry types[^entry-types]. Have fun and good luck!

[^entry-types]: All entries will be verified for completion prior to randomly selecting winners. Following and then unfollowing will do you no good as those entries won't be counted in the giveaway.
