Today my 365 project titled [**PaperFaces**](/paperfaces/) turns one --- holy smokes! In this past year I've managed to illustrate 476 portraits, make a ton of new *Paper friends*, burned through a few pen styli, and rekindled my passion for drawing. 

I honestly can't believe I've been drawing strangers for 365 days straight. I was half joking when I posted this and had no idea it would take off in the way that it did.
