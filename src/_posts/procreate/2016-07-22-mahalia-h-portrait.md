Portrait of Mahalia H. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/hZqgKD). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

Looks like the 3.1 update to Procreate improved support for Adobe's Ink stylus. Whether it was a set of changes to the [Jot Touch iOS SDK](https://github.com/Adonit/Adonit-iOS-SDK) or Procreate I don't know, but the stylus seems to register input more reliably with an iPad Air 2.

I'm sure it's nowhere close to the responsiveness one experiences with Apple's Pencil[^apple-pencil], but for the budget-minded it does the job.

[^apple-pencil]: I still haven't had the opportunity to try an [iPad Pro and Apple Pencil]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2015-09-25-ipad-pro %}) yet. I know I know... :frowning:
