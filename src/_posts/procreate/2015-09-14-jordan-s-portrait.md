Portrait of Jordan S. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/BXA9OC ). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2. 

Not as muddy as some of my other Procreate paintings, but it still has that *oil* feel. I'm determined to make these tools behave more like watercolor, ink, and pencil if it's the last thing I do.
