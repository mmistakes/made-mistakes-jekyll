Portrait of Wendy inspired by a portrait I [originally drew in Paper]({% post_url /paperfaces/2012-09-01-veganwendy-portrait %}) and [revisited]({% post_url /paperfaces/2014-08-29-veganwendy-2-portrait %}) several years later. Digitally painted with Procreate on a 3rd generation iPad. 

This was my first attempt at using [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/) and decided to give it a try in between working on my [PaperFaces Project](/paperfaces/).

Having used [FiftyThree's Paper app](http://www.fiftythree.com/) exclusively up until this point I was quickly overwhelmed by all of Procreate's features. The power was certainly there, but the simplicity of picking up an iPad and stylus to start a sketch wasn't.

Paper's sketchbook motif resonated with me more than the approach digital painting powerhouses like Procreate were pursuing. Learning a complex and feature rich app was not something I had the time to mess with. So I abandoned Procreate with the goal of returning to it a year or two...
