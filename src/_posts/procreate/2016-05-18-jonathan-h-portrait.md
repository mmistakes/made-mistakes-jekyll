Portrait of Jonathan H. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/4cnY0H ). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

The more I've been using this [**Adonit Ink**](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-Creative-Connected-Precision-Stylus/dp/B00LNECVN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1461688574&sr=8-1&keywords=adobe+ink&linkCode=ll1&tag=mademist-20&linkId=85c30649adf50e2ff0b9c753f6dfe2c9) stylus the more I want an Apple Pencil. 

I knew going in that support for the Ink was likely going to be poor with my **iPad Air 2**. That hasn't stopped me from trying to get the most out of it though. It reminds me of the days of using a Pogo Connect that would register a touch around 60% of the time forcing you to redo your marks.

Maybe I should just give the digital stuff a break for now and go old school with paper and pencil. Using such powerful tools like the iPad and [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/) make things almost too easy. If I'm to improve my observation and drawing skills I really need to focus on the basics.

Only problem I have is I love the freedom and convenience of digital art. I've gotten so used to not working at a desk and getting messy it would be hard to go back. Hmm...
