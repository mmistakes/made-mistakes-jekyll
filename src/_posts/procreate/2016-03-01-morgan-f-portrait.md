Portrait of Morgan F. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/rK7LX). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

Going back to my friend the **round brush** in Procreate has been fun. I've experimented with textured brushes recently, but haven't been completely happy with the results compared to the default round brush.

I've found playing with opacity and the glazing toggles gets color results similar to what I'd achieve with [Paper's watercolor brush]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-09-16-watercolor-brush-update %}). Brushes in Procreate don't exactly have the same level of organic-ness, but with enough glazes and on-canvas mixing you can get close.
