message: "Hi Michael\r\nI've never found anything that makes the transition from pencil and paper to digital that is so effortless.  More so because of your great tutorials.  I have a  question on neutralizing colors by mixing with complement.  I dragged the small circle around the color mixer with the compliment also selected but I didn't see a difference.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the instruction: \"To neutralize them, do one full rotation of the Color Mixer with both complementary colors selected.\"\r\n\r\nMy Pencil by 53 is on the way, but I'm learning while using my finger and another stylus."
