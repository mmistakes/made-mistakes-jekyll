message: "I've noticed that painting with the Pencil stylus allows you paint faster
  and does seem to produce a smoother tone easier, but the same effect is possible
  using just your finger.\r\n\r\nTry moving in a small circular pattern as you paint,
  it will help even things. And of course do not lift your finger off the screen or
  else you'll start to darken areas and won't get that smooth tone.\r\n\r\nOther than
  that keep practicing."
