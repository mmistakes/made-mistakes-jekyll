message: "Wow. Many thanks. This is brilliant. New to Paper but I love it already.
  My work is in oil or oil pastel, and Paper will give me a great way to get the best
  composition and keep me loosened up. The step by step is a great way to get stuck
  in with fab results straight away. Good teacher. Cheers."
