message: "Hi Michael. I'm upgrading my site which is based on Phlow's Feeling Responsive; I figured the best way is to do that is to simply migrate my small site over to the code based on mademistakes. It's an awesome site. There is though one thing I can't figure out how to do which is to get a large header like this: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/layout-header-image-text-readability/.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, though I started out looking for a way to upgrade my site's Foundation code, I discover a whole new world of painting on the iPad. I now got a 53 pencil and Procreate. Thank you for sharing with the world your very own beautiful world. You've made us all so much richer."
