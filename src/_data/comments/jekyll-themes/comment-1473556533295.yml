message: "Made Mistakes isn't the same code base as my Minimal Mistakes theme. Some things are similar but not all. It also isn't that documented since it's my personal site.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest using Minimal Mistakes since that is released and [documented](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) as a full fledged theme."
