message: "First of all I would like to say wonderful blog!\r\nI had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself and \r\nclear your mind before writing. I've had a tough time clearing my \r\nthoughts in getting my thoughts out. I truly do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted simply just trying to figure out \r\nhow to begin. Any suggestions or hints? Appreciate it!\r\n\r\nFeel free to visit my blog: [Maxtropin Supplement](https://www.reddit.com/user/annalee889/ \"Maxtropin Supplement\")"
