message: "If you added up all the time I've spent on the site over the years it's probably a :poop: ton! Writing articles definitely eats up most of the time. It takes me forever to write even the simplest post... which is why I don't post all that often.\r\n\r\nArticles of this length tend to take me 5--20 hours to produce over the course of a week or two. Just from all the distractions and other commitments in my life... can be hard to focus on a single thing at once :flushed:.\r\n\r\nThe design and layout stuff comes much faster. I'm constantly making small adjustments as I experiment with new things. I don't get too hung up if I break something here, it's one big learning experience for me."
