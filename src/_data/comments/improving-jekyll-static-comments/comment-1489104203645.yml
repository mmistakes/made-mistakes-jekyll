message: "Michael, please, can you explain the `page__comments` snippet? If it just checks if the parent is `nil`, how does it display all comments? (I'm definitely missing something obvious here, but hey, it's 1 AM).\r\nThanks for the tutorial! One tip though: the required fields should have a `required` attribute. You know, for accessibility :) ."
