message: "I used this set of Rake tasks to [export comments in Disqus](https://github.com/pathawks/jekyll-disqus-comments) to use with Staticman. Perhaps it can be modified to do the same with Blogger.\r\n\r\nBlogger lets you [export your blog into an XML file](https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41387?visit_id=1-636355458136931298-4026338400&rd=1) which you could probably pull data out of. Not sure if it includes all the comments though. Jekyll has a Blogger [import tool](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/) so perhaps you can get some ideas from that?"
