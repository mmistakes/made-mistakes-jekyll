message: "Thanks for writing the steps in such details. I think yours is the only blog that has been laying out the details of using __Staticman__ as the experience that followed.\r\n\r\nYour website is one of the most, if not the most articulate example of web design I have come across, both aesthetically and technically. You are always constantly redesigning and improving this site, playing with cutting edge tech. I can only imagine what else happens before generating the site. :)\r\n**How much time do you spend coding this site on average?** If you do not mind me asking of course. I am asking because I am currently scared of the level of commitment that is required to treat your website as a piece of art....\r\n\r\n_This comment became so lengthy that I emailed you the rest._"
