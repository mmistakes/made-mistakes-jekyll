  Staticman recently [added support for
  reCAPTCHA](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/20) which has
  completely eliminated all of the spam comments that would slip through. I'm
  sure Akismet would have done the same, but since it's not enabled for the
  public instance of Staticman this was the next best thing.
