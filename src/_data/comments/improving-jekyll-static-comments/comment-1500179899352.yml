message: "I really appreciate your help. \r\n\r\nYou are right that I'm using a CI service, but after some more testing, I found that the ordering of replies is completely unpredictable and it is changing both on my local and on the production. I'm on the latest version of Jekyll (3.5). Maybe that's causing the difference. BTW, I have been using the latest code from your GH repo.\r\n\r\nSo I made a minor modification to your code to use the parent's _id field as the replying-to value of the child, instead of relying on the position of the comments (because that seems to be unpredictable at least in my environment). Now it seems to be working consistently.\r\n\r\nI'm yet to get into reply notifications and MailGun setup. If I run into any issues, I may seek your help again.\r\n\r\nI must say that your 2 blog posts on staticman have been extremely helpful. Without your posts I may not have even made a serious attempt at it. \r\n\r\nI don't have enough words to thank you!"
