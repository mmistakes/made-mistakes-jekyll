message: "Thanks, Michael. I'm going to first re-enable Recaptcha as I don't think the honey pot is sweet enough. About reply notification, I guess you are right that the unsubscribe option should mitigate the risk. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes.\r\n\r\nOne other thought I had was to make use of browser local storage to store commenter's Name, Email and Website so that return visitors who have commented before do not have to type those details again (as long as they don't clear their cache). What do you think about that?"
