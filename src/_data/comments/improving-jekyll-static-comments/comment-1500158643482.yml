message: "Great!\r\n\r\nNot sure what could be going on with the comment order. I've heard of others having the same issue so you're not alone. If you're using the same instance of Jekyll to build and serve then the output should be exactly the same. If you're using some sort of CI service to build/deploy your site then it's possible the environments and Jekyll versions are out of sync and that's the issue.\r\n\r\nI am using unique id's to attach child comments to their parent by using the `replying_to` field. There's a chance my code above is old and outdated. If you haven't already, reference my GitHub repo instead since that is the actual code I use to build comments on my site.\r\n\r\n- [`_includes/comments.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_includes/comments.html)\r\n- [`_includes/comment.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_includes/comment.html)"
