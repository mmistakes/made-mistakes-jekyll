message: "Michael, thanks a ton for this post! I used it as the base for my own implementation over at https://github.com/GonzaloZiadi/windespair. Some things I had to change: \r\n* \"item.replying_to == '' \"  rather than  \"item.replying_to == blank\" \r\n* {% assign comments = site.data.comments[page.slug] | where_exp:\"item\", \"item.replying_to == ''\" | sort: 'date' %} rather than {% assign comments = site.data.comments[page.slug] | where_exp:\"item\", \"item.replying_to == blank\" %} as even though I followed your comment naming convention, posts were being sorted in reverse alphabetical order so the replies were showing under the wrong parent comment. Now that I think about it maybe | reverse would work the same as | sort 'date' in my case. \r\nI also tried to use the comment _id field as the \"link\" between child and parent rather than the for loop index, but I kept getting errors about 'nesting too deep'. I feel like using the _id field would be better though as then sorting the comments by date or some other parameter would become doable. What do you think?\r\n* I didn't want to use jquery so I changed a bit how the replies work. Same concept, different implementation.\r\n* I changed the css a little, but it is heavily inspired by yours.\r\n* I changed the website input type to text instead of url. The url regex is annoying, to me, as it requires users to put the http:// in front of their url. I feel like they shouldn't have to do this.\r\n\r\nIf it piques your curiosity in the very least, in my _includes folder I have your same three files (comments, comment, and comment-form) and in my _layouts folder in default.html in a script tag at the bottom of the file I have the js code for the replies. Thanks again!"
