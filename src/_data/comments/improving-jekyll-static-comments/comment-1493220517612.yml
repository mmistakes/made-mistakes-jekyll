message: "Are you using replies on your site? You might run into problems eliminating the `where` filter since that first loop will include parent comments along with their children (the replies).\r\n\r\nI had a hell of a time getting it to filter out properly. The `where` and `where_exp` filters seem to be really picky if your data array doesn't match. It all comes down to how your data files are constructed. Perhaps yours are slightly different than mine."
