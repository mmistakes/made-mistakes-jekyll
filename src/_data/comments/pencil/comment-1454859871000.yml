message: "Michael, this and all of your Paper tutorials are fantastic. Thank you
  so much for sharing your techniques and tips. Question, can you provide all of these
  in an ePub or PDF format so one can download them and read it in iBooks? I would
  very gladly pay for something like this. Just a thought."
