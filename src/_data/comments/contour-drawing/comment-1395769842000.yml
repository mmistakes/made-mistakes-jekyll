message: "You do it exactly how you described it. Drag the color onto the background
  and release. One thing to note is it's not a fill. If you have something on the
  canvas already it will cover it all up with whatever color you drag over.\r\n\r\nThis
  page has a [video showing how to fill the page with color](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/articles/893689-using-color#fill-with-color) if you need a visual."
