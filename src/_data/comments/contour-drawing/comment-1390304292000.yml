message: "Guess it depends on what you want to get out of the exercise. If you
  want to develop your hand eye coordination than doing them blind, never looking
  down, and completing the drawing in one line is the preferred method.\r\n\r\nI like
  the look of contour line drawings so I often use it as a stylist approach and less
  of an drawing exercise. When I do that I will look down to check results or make
  course corrections to fit the piece."
