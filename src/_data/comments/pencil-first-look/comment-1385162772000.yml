message: "Pressure sensitivity is a huge one for me. I simply can't get thinner
  watercolor strokes without it. The fact that Pencil doesn't have that could be a
  bummer, but I think it more than makes up for it by being a stylus that is really
  responsive, feels great, and adds features to Paper that other styli simply can't
  do.\r\n\r\nLately I haven't been too happy with my Pogo because of the tip problems.
  TenOne Design's customer service is really great, but I don't think that should
  give them a pass. And Apple screwing them by breaking compatibility with the iPad
  Air doesn't help.\r\n\r\nI think I'll be able to live without pressure sensitivity
  once Pencil starts to mature in ways I'm sure FiftyThree is already planning for.
  With its current feature set I think it's designed more for the masses who wrestle
  with drawing and need features like palm rejection, or a dedicated eraser on the
  top. It's not really for us \"advanced\" folk who want the extra complexity of pressure
  sensitive strokes, which is why I think it wasn't a focus this time around.\r\n\r\nThat's
  not to say pro users can't get a lot out of Pencil. Blend is extremely nuanced and
  I think it's going to be interesting to see where that goes once more people get
  to play with it. I'm sure in the beginning there will be a ton of abusing the feature
  like the dreaded lens flare filter in Photoshop, but it really does have promise.
  As does the eraser on top. I could see that gaining new abilities by way of simple
  app updates."
