message: ""Thanks for this, it was a great help to getting me started.\nOnly one thing: the command line to flash has a couple of errors in it.\nIt should be \"--baud 9600\" and \"-fm=dio\".  The baudrate could probably be higher (from what I've read) but 9600bd give me time to get another beer.\nAnother tip would be to re-name the folder to esptool from esptool-master -- maybe that's a newbie thing, but it's fewer characters to type. \nAlso, the flashing leaves the device without a init.lua -- which is probably a by-design thing.  Live and learn from the efforts of others.""
