message: "You were right about the \"-fm dio\".  I have discovered that I get consistently good results with this command line:  \nesptool.py --baud 115200 --port /dev/tty.wchusbserial1450 write_flash -fm dio -fs 32m 0x00000 ../nodemcu_integer_0.9.6-dev_20150704.bin  \nSo you can see that I have graduated to a higher baudrate.  \nLive and learn."
