message: "Hi Poul-- Being new to this particular processor, I'm spending a lot of time trying to get traction.  Your original command line didn't work for me so I googled around and found those two differences between what you had used and what had worked for others.  Changing those two parameters (perhaps incorrectly identified as errors: &ldquo;&ndash;baud 9600&rdquo; and &ldquo;-fm=dio&rdquo;) made things work for me.  I will go back an try and see whether it not working the first try was the result of something else.  It's not that I want to flash more slowly, just that I was not successful with 921600.  I don't know what baudrates are supported, but I'm sure there is a list out there somewhere.  The good news is that I *can* flash and that ESPlorer works like a charm. The goal of this exercise for me is to make a WiFi-controlled WS2812 LED controller. starting from the LED web page example floating around the internet. The problem with getting there is this is that I cannot consistently connect to the device with my iPhone. When I do connect and am able to call up the 192.168.1.1 web page, the connection is dropped within a few seconds. Windows and a MacBook will connect without issues and not drop.  There are a few posts on the expressif forum on this subject and the consensus seems to be that the firmware needs to initialize the wifi config struct completely or i-devices will have trouble connecting.  I haven't dug into the source code of the firmware I flashed to see if that is being done. If it is, I will need to look elsewhere for the solution. Thanks, jm"
