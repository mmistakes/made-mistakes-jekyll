message: "Hi Poul--  \nWhile you were enjoying your holidays, I was busy and after much experimenting also discovered that browsers (notably Safari) can be VERY picky about html. I invested some time to get the right headers and now get consistent results across the browsers that matter to me. I will take close look at your work and see if I can improve. I have read that to effectively program the ESP8266, you have to divorce yourself from a purely procedural programming paradigm -- something which is difficult for me because, although I do not program a lot (or as a job), I've been programming for a long time (~1971) and a procedural mindset is hard to break out of.  \nMy other challenge is getting my iPhone to connect consistently and without dropping to the ESP. I am not getting a connection consistently and it often drops. I don't have any other phones to test it with so maybe it's not an iPhone-only problem. Connecting when it's in station mode is not a problem.  \nThanks from Texas!"
