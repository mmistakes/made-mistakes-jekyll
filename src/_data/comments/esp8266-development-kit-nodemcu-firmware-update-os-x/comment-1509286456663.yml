message: "Hi JM\n\nThanks for the feedback and great that it got you started! You say it has a couple of errors, can you specify what kind of errors? I have been using the commands in this post many times and they work for me. The \"-fm dio\" should just work fine, in fact the official [readme file](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) for esptool.py mentions it just like that without the \"=\". And I am not sure why you want to flash at a slower speed, since I am flashing at a faster speed just fine (I don't need time to get another beer :) ). And yes, the missing `init.lua` is by design, but it is easy to upload a default one from [here](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/master/examples/init.lua) if you need it.\n\n/Poul"
