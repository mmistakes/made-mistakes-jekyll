message: "Hi JM\n\nSorry for the late reply, but just got back from vacation. I had some issues connecting to the ESP8266 using NodeMCU and Safari on OS X and IOS. I got it working using the webserver in my post [here](/projects/esp8266-nodemcu-ihc-wireless-webserver-light-switch/) which might help. My problem was that I did not send the correct response headers back and the different browsers all reacted differently. Also I am using the development branch of NodeMCU so that might help.\n\n/Poul"
