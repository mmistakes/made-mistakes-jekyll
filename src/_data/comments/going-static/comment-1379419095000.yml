message: "Depends on how large the site is. I have around 700 posts and it takes
  a few minutes to build the site. It can also depend on the sort of _plugins, using
  related posts, the various generators you have going too, etc. If you it's a basic
  site with under 50 posts it should build really fast.\r\n\r\nIt can get kind of bothersome
  if you're writing new posts and want to view them locally before deploying, since
  it has to rebuild the entire site. In that case you can tell Jekyll to limit it's
  build to X amount of posts. I usually run it with `jekyll build --limit_posts 10`
  to see the latest 10 posts. That builds fast and allows me to test before I do a
  full site build.\r\n\r\nPretty sure it's on the radar of the Jekyll folks to address
  this issue. But probably won't happen anytime soon."
