message: "Nice! I love Jekyll.\r\n\r\nAdd me to the list of those wanting support
  for native grids in Paper. It would be even better if the grids were on their own
  layer and you can toggle them on/off.\r\n\r\nYou might have better luck taking a
  piece of cardboard and cutting your own T-square. I had a lot of problems using
  metal and plastic ones I have laying around the house. They either slide around
  too much on the iPad's glass screen or they register as a touch and won't let you
  draw on the screen at the same time."
