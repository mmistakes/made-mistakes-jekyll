  parts of a light and thin cloud. For the really thin streaky ones it's basically
  just some horizontal pencil strokes. I use shading more in the fluffier clouds to
  add roundness to some parts.\r\n\r\n2. And you're right on the sun being lit and
  everything else in silo. I went with a more dramatic eclipse that you'd almost never
  see. Just my *artistic* interpretation."
