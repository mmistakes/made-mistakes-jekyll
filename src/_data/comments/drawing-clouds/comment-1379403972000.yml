message: "This is great--thank you very much for providing these tutorials! Really
  useful.\r\n\r\nTwo questions about this one:\r\n\r\n1. I don't quite understand what
  you're doing to create the cloud wisps. Is that the pencil tool? And is it more
  like shading, or crosshatching, or just a few individual lines? In your closeup
  (with the arrows drawn on it), it looks like a few short angled individual lines,
  but in the finished piece it looks more like a few longer almost-flat individual
  lines, and somewhere in one of the sample image writeups (which are also really
  useful!) I think you said something about shading.\r\n2. I'm not understanding
  why/when the sun would appear as a silhouetted black half-circle--isn't the light
  of the sun what's causing other things to appear as silhouettes?\r\n\r\nThanks again,
  and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!"
