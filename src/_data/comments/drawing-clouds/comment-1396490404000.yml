message: "If you pinch the page in the center of the canvas as if you were folding
  it in half it will zoom out to a view where you can add a new page or go to another
  journal.\r\n\r\nYou can also flip through pages by swiping from the left or right
  edges inwards. Doing a swipe from the right edge on the last page of a journal will
  create a new blank page.\r\n\r\nOn [FiftyThree's support site](https://support.fiftythree.com/hc/en-us/articles/201592322-Basic-Features) they have videos that
  show all of these gestures in action if you need a visual."
