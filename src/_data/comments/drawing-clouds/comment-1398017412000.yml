message: "Thanks Michael for sharing all these tutorials! I had the paper app for
  a while, but I discovered this site a few days ago and now I can't stop drawing.
  I finally start to understand how to make the most out of it and I already see a
  big improvement.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work and I am looking forward for more,
  especially how to draw faces!"
