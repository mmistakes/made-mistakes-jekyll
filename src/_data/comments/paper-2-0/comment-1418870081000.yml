message: "Thanks for the thorough article on these bugs! I'm glad to see I'm not
  the only one. I posted on 53's support threads about the update killing my ability
  to use a Bamboo stylus to blend. Their response indicated that they were unaware
  of this but that they would pass it on to the engineers. I hope they take care of
  it because I really can't go back to blending with my finger. Has anyone else mentioned
  it to 53 and/or heard anything else about plans to fix it?"
