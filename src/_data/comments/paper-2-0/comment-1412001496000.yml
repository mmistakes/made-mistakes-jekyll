message: "I noticed a similar thing with some styli erasing when Pencil is connected.
  I couldn't reproduce it 100% of the time but it does happen. At one point I had
  Blend turned off and my finger started erasing stuff. That was partially my fault
  because my other hand was pressing down the Eraser end of Pencil while my finger
  slide across the screen, but I did have it happen a few times when I wasn't holding
  Pencil."
