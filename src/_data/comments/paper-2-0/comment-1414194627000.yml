message: "Thank you for another enlightening article, Michael! It is a relief knowing
  these are not problems due to my naive lack of skills... In fact when I noticed
  my Bamboo and Targus Styluses were drawing instead of blending I experienced sorrow
  for a while ... Then I thought it was not such a terrible thing to happen. 'Cause
  I could save my Pencil tip from wearing out when painting over larger areas... Anyway
  I hope bug corrections will come soon..."
