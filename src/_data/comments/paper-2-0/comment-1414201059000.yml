message: "Maybe I'm not noticing the bugs as much because I'm using the new iPad
  Air 2 that has some changes with touch.\r\n\r\nTo be honest none of these bugs have
  really plagued me. I have to go out of my way to reproduce them. Could be my particular
  way of drawing and using the tools doesn't trigger them as much. The Bamboo bug
  in particular doesn't bother me since I blend with my finger as the tool was intended."
