message: "I've seen a few bring it up that the Bamboo doesn't let you blend anymore.
  Since it has been a few months since then with no change my guess is it's not a
  high priority.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is to try a different stylus that has a
  thicker nub if blending with your finger isn't an option. I only use my finger so
  I can't really say if it's gotten better with recent updates or not. I tend to use
  all of the tools as they were designed rather than fighting with the app."
