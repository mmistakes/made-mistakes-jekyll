message: "Glad to hear you caught the Sktchy bug!\r\n\r\nBecoming proficient with
  the watercolor brush definitely takes practice. From using different styli I've
  noticed they all pretty much make the same mark. The big difference has been when
  I use a Pogo Connect. I don't know if it's because it has a pressure sensitive tip,
  but it seems fill paint quicker than the other styli, which in turn makes for a
  smoother wash.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Pencil or any other stylus I have to really slow
  down how quick I paint or else it gets blotchy. That's the key to smoothness. Which
  can be hard sometimes because if you linger in an area too long might turn too dark.
  It really is a balancing act between speed, value, and the color you choose to paint
  with."
