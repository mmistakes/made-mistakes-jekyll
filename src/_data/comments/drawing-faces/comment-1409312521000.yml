message: "Hi Michael, you have definitely encouraged me to go digital, and I am
  enjoying it immensely. I up have also caught the Sktchy bug thanks to you.\r\n\r\nStill have a lot of problems producing smooth brush washes, and the only stylus
  that suits my hand is an Adonit JotPro, so I am not going to buy the Pencil just
  for the Blend. Hope that Paper introduces it for the rest of us. Meanwhile: practice,
  practice, practice!"
