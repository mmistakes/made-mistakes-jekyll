message: "Check out my [article about the Color Picker](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/color-picker/). At the very end I share a
  link to my skin tone palette on Mix that can be downloaded to Paper. Click it and
  hit remix and Paper will open it letting you sample the colors with the new Color
  Picker or look up the values.\r\n\r\n"
