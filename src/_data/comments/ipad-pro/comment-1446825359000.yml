message: "Great Article. I too like Procreate but sometimes feel there are too
  many options which can be overwhelming. Also wished they would put the color palettes
  and tools always visible like in Paper.\r\n\r\nAs for the iPad Pro will be getting
  it at launch and will probable get a charging Apple Pencil dock from Moxiware."
