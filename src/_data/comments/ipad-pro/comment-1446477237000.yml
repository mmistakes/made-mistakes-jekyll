message: "My inner artist screams, I want that...but I'm a waiter by nature. The
  best time to purchase if you want one soon would be to wait till January and buy
  one from Best Buy in an opened box return. They are certified with full warranties.
  I have always purchased popular electronics this way and have never had to return
  any. Buying after Christmas returns...IT'S A GOOD THING..."
