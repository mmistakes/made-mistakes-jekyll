message: "Let me be that inner artist in you and give it to you straight: yes,
  you're going to get an iPad Pro on Launch Day, and yes, you're going to have the
  time of your life with it. You're too curious and way too talented to pass this
  opportunity up. All those thoughts about *it's too expensive, it's too beta, it's
  too unnecessary* - they will all go away moments after you start playing with Apple
  Pencil. Trust your gut instinct on this.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself, have you ever regretted
  the iPad Air 2 purchase? Was your previous iPad not good enough when you had it?
  Or the purchase of that new iPhone when the old one was still packing a good punch?
  You will love the iPad Pro, and it will be an investment into yourself as an artist.
  It's the tablet you've we been waiting for. Why wait longer? There's always *a
  better device coming soon*, but with that attitude, you'll be forever waiting and
  not creating. And that's just not you.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure about it, buy
  it on launch day anyway and return it within 2 weeks. They'll give you a full refund
  and won't ask questions. That will be a much bigger challenge, one you will pass
  easily if you feel the technology just isn't there yet. Without buying it, and
  thoroughly testing it, you'll never know what it's like to use the iPad Pro and
  Apple Pencil. Besides, you'll get a good blog post out of it too ;-)\r\n\r\nPS:
  I'm not working for Apple, and I don't get a commission when you buy the iPad
  Pro."
