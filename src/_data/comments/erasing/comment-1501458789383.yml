Verify your Pencil is [updated to the latest firmware](https://support.fiftythree.com/hc/en-us/articles/201577742-Upgrading-the-Pencil-Firmware).\r\n\r\nIf it's still not erasing from the top then you probably have defective Pencils. I'd suggest reaching out to FiftyThree's support for further troubleshooting."
