message: "Yeah, pencil just does not, nor has it ever, simply erased. I have never been able to just flip the thing over and erase, like with a real pencil. I have the black and the maple, and neither do it. The eraser is treated just like a stylus tip, which makes for frustrating drawing...any ideas?\r\n\r\nJohn"
