message: "Hi Rahat. What you've described is quite common so you're not alone. I
  talk about this some in my [Pencil review](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/), but here's a quick recap if
  you haven't read it.\r\n\r\nIn my experience Blend sometimes misfires if you aren't
  pressing hard enough when drawing. Pressing down on the tip while drawing registers
  as an input with Paper, while lightly gliding the tip across the screen might not.\r\n\r\nThere
  is a spring in the tip that I can only guess aids in decipher touches versus non
  touches. Paper tries to be smart about these touches too which is why sometimes
  you might observe a blend or stroke disappear or correct itself.\r\n\r\nThe more
  you use Pencil the less it happens, but it can still be quite annoying even after
  getting comfortable with the stylus. A possible solution is to turn off the Blend
  feature until you need it. It's not ideal, but will solve the misfires. You can
  modify Pencils's behavior by tapping the 53 circle in the upper right corner, tapping
  Pencil, and then flipping Finger between \"Blend\" and \"Nothing\" depending on if you
  want to use it or not."
