message: "I'm using a [Pogo Connect stylus](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/) to get a thinner stroke with the Paper's
  brush tool. It currently is the only pressure sensitive stylus Paper supports. I
  wrote about it in greater detail but the basic idea is the harder you press the
  the wider the stroke.\r\n\r\nSo when I'm painting
  in smaller spots I barely touch the screen which thins out the brush to about half
  as wide as you can possibly get without a Pogo Connect.\r\n\r\nFor me that makes
  the Pogo extremely interesting because it lets you do things with Paper's tools
  no other stylus can. There are a handful of other pressure sensitive styli on the
  market that look way better than the Pogo Connect, but sadly none work with Paper.\r\n\r\nWorth
  noting, if you have an iPad Air or Retina Mini I wouldn't bother with a Pogo Connect.
  They have horrible support and barely work since Apple changed the technology behind
  their screens."
