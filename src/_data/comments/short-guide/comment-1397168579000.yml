message: "Hi Michael, i am quite struggling while using the Pencil on paper 53
  app. I was really excited when i received it yesterday, it does amazing job to some
  extent. The main problem i am facing right now it falls out of track from its right
  course of action. I mean while i am using the brush tool with the pencil it slips
  off many times and instead of putting color on paper it starts blending; which is
  quite annoying. my assumption was i can only blend colors when i am using my finger,
  then why the pencil tip is doing that? Is there something wrong with the pencil
  tip i got or i am not using it from right angle ! please advise ..."
