message: "Hi Michael, I noticed while watching the time lapse video you are able
  to fill in the blue background (:45 sec into the video) with the brush tool without
  going inside the lines of your characters, even in the tight places that are more
  narrow than the width of the brush (between the two center characters). Is there
  a technique for doing that? You didn't use the zoom in loop so I'm not sure how
  you managed it. Whenever I try to fill in a tight spot (like the angle formed between
  neck and chin) with the brush tool, the brush tool width is too wide to fill it
  without going into the lines of the other parts of the drawing. Thanks. Love your
  lessons"
