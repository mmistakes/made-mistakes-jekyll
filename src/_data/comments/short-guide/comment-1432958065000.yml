message: "Have you updated Paper recently? They added a new set of tools called
  [**Think Kit**](http://www.fiftythree.com/think). These tools let you draw perfectly straight lines, circles, squares,
  and arrows. So what was done here is they drew one blue circle and then used the
  new cut tool to reposition and copy/duplicate the circle several times. Then drew
  over that with the pen tool freehand.\r\n\r\n"
