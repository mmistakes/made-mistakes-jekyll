message: "Yes there is a way to save it without the background. Just zoom out the
  page and hit the Share circle button. Then if you tap on the Camera Roll icon it'll
  give you an option to toggle to background on/off. Just turn it off, save to your
  Camera Roll and then you can email or share it through Photostream.\r\n\r\nIt'll
  give you a `.PNG` file with a transparent background."
