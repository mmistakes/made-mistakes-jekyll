message: "FiftyThree just put out a nice example of building up a car from basic
  structures but what I can't figure out is how to do the same sized circle multiple
  times. They also sent out an example a few weeks ago with a lattice of same sized
  circles. Too similar to be eye balled. How?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance ... I hope.
