message: "Hi Michael,\r\nI just discovered your lessons as I am just getting into iPad art and I think they are really awesome! I apologize if I am being redundant about anything, but exactly which iPad are you using for this? I have an iPad Air 1 and am having trouble finding others who use this iPad and know which styli work with it. I understand apple changed the technology in the air 2, which is why I am often confused whether a stylus will work properly with my iPad. Would you recommend the Pencil to use with Paper, or the Pogo Connect, specifically on the iPad Air 1?  I've been reading great things on both styli but am unsure if it is for Air 1 or 2.\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my unnecessarily wrong message, and I look forward to hearing back! \r\nKeep up the great work!"
