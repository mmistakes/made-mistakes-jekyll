message: "@Cari - I have an iPad Air 2 and you can read up on my [stylus recommendations here](https://mademistakes.com/faqs/stylus-recommendations/). Pencil has good [compatibility with older devices](https://support.fiftythree.com/hc/en-us/articles/201712591-Using-Pencil#ipad-compatibility) and does work with the original Air.\r\n\r\nI had the original Pogo Connect and used that with an iPad 3rd gen. I know when the original Air came out it had all kinds of issues with it and pretty sure didn't work since Apple changed the screen tech. There's a Pogo Connect 2 now that works with the Air 2, but no idea if it works with the original Air. Probably best to check the manufacturer's site."
