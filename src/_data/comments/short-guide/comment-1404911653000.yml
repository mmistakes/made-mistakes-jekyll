message: "Yes that's correct. When you connect Pencil to Paper it unlocks the tools,
  but they only stay unlocked for 30 days. You'll need to connect Pencil again and
  they'll unlock for another 30 days. Rinse/repeat.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell it's
  a measure 53 took to lock the tools down to those who actually \"own\" Pencil. Otherwise
  you could just connect a friend's Pencil to your iPad once and have the tools for
  free. It's not a big deal if you actually own Pencil and use it -- the tools will
  stay unlocked that way."
