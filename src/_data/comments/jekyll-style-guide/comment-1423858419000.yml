message: "Hey Michael! Thank you for sharing. Since I saw the [pattern library by Mail Chimp](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns) I wanted to create a styleguide and already began. Like you, I want to do it with Jekyll. But doing it with a dedicated collection didn't cross my mind. Thank you for all your insights. Thank you for sharing your ideas and knowledge."
