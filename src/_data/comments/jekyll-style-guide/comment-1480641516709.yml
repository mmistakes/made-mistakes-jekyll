message: "Hey Michael, thanks for replying! \r\n\r\nJust thought of another slightly quirky way of achieving this DRY-ness.\r\n\r\nWhat if a component markup is stored in `_includes/components/btn.html` and the collection document includes it via `{% include components/btn.html text=\"click me\" %}`? This could also be a nudge to liquidify the components for reuse in multiple contexts (e.g., same button with different copy)"
