message: "The thought never occurred to me to output the collection documents as includes. That would be pretty cool if you could output to `_includes` to DRY things up.\r\n\r\nBut I get the feeling that folder is probably reserved by Jekyll, or that it would end up outputting to `_site/_includes` which wouldn't help.\r\n\r\nWorth some testing though :smile:"
