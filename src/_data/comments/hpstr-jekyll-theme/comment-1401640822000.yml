message: "I'm sure it's possible but you'll have to hack up the CSS and JS a bit
  to do it. I'd start with finding a way you're happy with applying a id or class
  to the body tag... on just the homepage. That will give you a hook to style the
  menu differently on just that page and hopefully allow you to keep it open there
  and revert to the close position on every other page."
