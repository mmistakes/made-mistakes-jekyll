message: "Those characters are added using `:after` pseudo classes on the list items
  in the menu. It's easier to follow what's going on in the [source `less` file](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/blob/1.3.2/assets/less/dl-menu.less) so I'd suggest making your
  edits there and compiling it into `main.min.css` or I suppose you could just work
  with the minified .css directly.\r\n\r\nBasically I'm using the Font Awesome webfont
  on those elements and inserting a Font Awesome icon using CSS `content` declarations. Look
  around line 101.\r\n\r\nTo swap the icon you'll need to find the one you want and
  use the corresponding Unicode. For example, to flip `>`
  to `<` you'd change `\\f105` to `\\f104`.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
