message: "That's good to hear. I think I mentioned it before but I didn't declare
  font sizes on all the text elements, so that could be why changing the `doc-font-size`
  variable has no effect. To change the entry content size look play around with the
  font-size set on `.entry-content`. Anywhere else you might have to add a font-size
  declaration to the element to override any browser defaults I didn't clear out in
  the CSS reset."
