message: "Amazing theme. I am constantly in awe that this is how my blog looks.\r\n\r\nOne question: a problem I haven't been able to solve...\r\n\r\nI've tried modifying the **pygments.less** `.font(15);` section to make the code snippet text bigger and I've tried to make the entire blog's body font bigger in **variables.less** `@doc-font-size:
  18;`\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows and node and grunt are installed properly. I ran `npm install`
  in the theme folder and then I tried modifying the fonts in those less files a couple
  times and then running grunt. I the `min.css` is recreated and I think it all runs
  properly except for the image minifier.
  \r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning \"recess:dist\" (recess) task\r\nFile \"assets/css/main.min.css\" created.\r\nOriginal: 68310 bytes.\r\nMinified:
  53648 bytes.\r\nRunning \"uglify:dist\" (uglify) task\r\nFile \"assets/js/scripts.min.js\"
  created.\r\nRunning \"imagemin:dist\" (imagemin) task\r\nFatal error: spawn ENOENT\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut
  the fonts never change their size when I look at the blog after doing this and I
  also inspected the text to confirm that the fonts didn't change. Am I missing
  something?"
