message: "How can a non-techie install on a WordPress blog?  I am used to tweaking
  things in the WordPress admin panel, but am not familiar with Jekyll or coding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most of your audience is more tech savvy, but you attract general artists
  too I'm sure. Are you going to start a theme biz? I love your design, and even
  if I do not know how to install your themes, they are simple and beautiful, what
  I look to use. Enjoy your art and blog much."
