message: "Absolutely correct. Sorry about being vague but you understood exactly
  the issue. I had to remove the `url` from the `_config.yml` file all together and just
  use the config in `s3_website.yml` and it did the trick. Still learning how all of
  this works. Thank you again for the response and for creating one of the best themes
  I've seen."
