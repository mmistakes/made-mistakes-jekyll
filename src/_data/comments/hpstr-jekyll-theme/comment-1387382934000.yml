message: "I got the changes in `pygments.less` fonts to start working. I'm not sure
  the modifications to `variables.less` for the body font (`@doc-font-size:` ) are working. Here's
  [my blog with your theme](http://mpron.github.io) :)\r\n\r\nThe
  new line in the package.json file didn't let the `npm install` run properly (I
  also tried adding `grunt-` to the front of it to match the others items).  How do
  you 'dump' the `node_modules` folder?  Delete everything in it and paste in the
  folder from the original repo?\r\n\r\nWhat files would I need to take from the Made
  Mistakes repo to be able to use `grunt-imgcompress`?"
