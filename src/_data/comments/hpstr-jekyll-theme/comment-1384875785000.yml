message: "Thanks Kat. This theme is only for Jekyll, I haven't ported it over to
  WordPress. You're right, Jekyll is a lot to take in.\r\n\r\nHave no plans for starting
  a theme biz, I'm just doing this for fun and sharing what I've come up with by playing
  around with my own personal site. There are so many good Wordpress themes out there
  I don't think I would be able to keep up with the competition.\r\n\r\nWith Jekyll
  there is barely any themes out there, so the expectations are much much lower. ;-)"
