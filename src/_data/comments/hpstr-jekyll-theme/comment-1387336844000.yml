message: "Thanks man!\r\n\r\nChanging the the font-size on the .highlight class
  in `pygments.less` should have worked but I just noticed that I put a font-size on
  the pre element, and because of how the cascade works that size is overriding the
  one you set on `.highlight`.\r\n\r\nIf you edit the pre element's font-size in `typography.less`
  on line 132 you should be all set.\r\n\r\nI bounce back between Windows and Mac OS
  X and noticed the same error when I was running grunt on a Windows 7 setup. If I
  remember correctly when you run `npm install` from the CLI a few dependencies
  for `grunt-contrib-imagemin` don't install properly and that's what the ENOENT error
  is referring to.\r\n\r\nI think the fix was to add a line to the `package.json` file
  to install an older `jpegtran-bin` dependency that will actually compile on a Windows
  7 machine. If you add\r\n\r\n`\"jpegtran-bin\": \"0.2.0\"` to devDependencies in
  `package.json` and then run `npm install` see if everything installs properly for
  `grunt-contrib-imagemin` and then try running grunt again. You might have to dump
  your `node_modules` folder first before running `npm install`, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nIf
  imagemin still doesn't work you could always use `grunt-imgcompress` instead and
  modify the grunt tasks or just remove it all together. That's what I'm using on
  this site (see my Made Mistakes repo to lift the grunt tasks).\r\n\r\nLet me know
  how it goes and if you hit any other hiccups."
