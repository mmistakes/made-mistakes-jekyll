message: "There are a few spots where I didn't declare font-sizes on elements and
  just let them use browser defaults, so that could be why you're not seeing any size
  changes. Just inspect the elements you want to alter in web dev tools and then apply
  an appropriate font-size in the .less files\r\n\r\nTo make the change to `grunt-imgcompress`
  I basically swapped out any reference to `imagemin` with it. Here's a gist that you
  can grab the [modified `package.json`](https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/142618b8ed2e16850bc0) and `Gruntfile.js` files. After you copy those
  into your repo just delete the `node_modules` folder and then run `npm install`. It'll
  download and install everything it needs and rebuild the modules.\r\n\r\nThat should hopefully
  clear everything up for you. I'm still new to Node and Grunt myself, so I'm by no
  means a pro."
