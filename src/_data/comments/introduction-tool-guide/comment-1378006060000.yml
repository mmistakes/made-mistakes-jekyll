message: "I wish I could get get the brushes in Photoshop to react like Paper's
  watercolor. It's the number one reason I keep going back to the app. It may not
  have all the bells and whistles as pro apps, but their watercolor is so damn nice.\r\n\r\nThat said, have you tried [**Tayasui Sketches**](http://www.tayasui.com/sketches/)? They have a Universal iOS app as well as a macOS app that are very similar to Paper by FiftyThree."
