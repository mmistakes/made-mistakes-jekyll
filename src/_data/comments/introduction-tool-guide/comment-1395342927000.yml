message: "Like you, I used the heck out of this app for a very long time. I finally
  walked away when I realized that they would never add an undo button option. Without
  it, the app is frustrating for me and many users. I have a physical disability that
  causes problems with my hands. Some users simply don't like the rewind feature.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
  the company knows it is an accessibility issue for some and have refused to accommodate
  by simply providing the option of an undo button for users who cannot use rewind
  for one reason or another. I wish Apple would require art apps to include this important
  feature, but I honestly don't think they should have to require it â€“ developers
  should want their apps to be accessible.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad because this really
  is an innovative app that encourages people from all walks of life to be more creative.
  Adding an undo button option wouldn't threaten 'rewind' (a similar app added it
  as an option, leaving their gesture-based undo as default). It would, however, require
  the development team to be less arrogant. Not holding my breath."
