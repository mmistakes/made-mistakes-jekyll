message: "There is! Once you have the color mixed the way you want, tap and hold
  on the small circle inside of the larger one and then drag it into a palette slot
  over in the lower right corner of the tool tray. If you drop it on top of an existing
  color it will replace it so be careful of that.\r\n\r\nYou can also rearrange the
  colors by tap and holding on them and if you screw up the default colors you can
  go into Paper's settings and reset them.\r\n\r\nAnother option if you fill up all
  your palette slots with colors is to make some swatches on your drawings. I sometimes
  do that by coloring a circle over to the side of the canvas and then use the [Color
    Picker tool](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/color-picker/) to sample it when needed. If you haven't used the picker yet and want
  some pointers I wrote an article about it."
