message: "Rewind and Zoom are both gesture based (meaning you need to use your
  fingers in specific motions). I would suggest watching the built in tutorial videos
  Paper comes with to see how they're done. If you tap the 53 circle in the upper
  right corner you can get at them.\r\n\r\nOr you can scroll down a few comments, I
  provided a link to FiftyThree's support forum where they have videos of all the
  gestures and tips for doing them.\r\n\r\nRewind can be tricky to master at first.
  The basic idea is you use two fingers and swipe them in a circular motion.Counter
  clockwise rewinds a mistake, and clockwise goes forward if you rewind too far.\r\n\r\nZoom
  works almost the same as pinching in the Photos app. Just take your two fingers
  and pinch outward. You should see a magnifying glass appear that you can re-position
  by dragging it at the circle's edge."
