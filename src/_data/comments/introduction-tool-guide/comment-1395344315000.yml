message: "Have you tried playing with the [AssistiveTouch options](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5587) in the iPad's Settings
  app? You can assign favorites to any gesture you want. In theory you would make
  one for Rewind and then you can activate it anytime you want.\r\n\r\nIt'll take an
  extra tap to do it, but it's an option until FiftyThree adds it natively to the
  app.\r\n\r\nAnother option, albeit expensive is to purchase a Pogo Connect stylus. It has a dedicated
  undo button on the pen that you can click to activate Rewind. That's how I do it
  since it's much quicker for small undos."
