message: "Being an artist, I've just about used every sketching, drawing, painting,
  apps available out there in art heaven!  There is nothing that comes close to Paper53!  I
  think it is the *simplicity* of the app, and the ability to create high quality
  sketches and paintings!  I'm using it for my art journal this year.  I am using
  an adonit stylus...it works great!  Love, love, love this app!"
