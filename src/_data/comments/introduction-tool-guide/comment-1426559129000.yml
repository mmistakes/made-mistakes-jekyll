message: "The rewind feature is the worst. Why do I have to put down my pencil
  and go through a very unstable process only to find that half the time it does not
  work. AND...every time it doesn't work, which is often, I end up with unwanted smudges
  an/or circular lines on my drawing. Fifty Three's refusal to acknowledge this problem
  only complicates the issue. Their own website has closed down comments in their
  own forum regarding all things relating to UNDO/Rewind. That says a lot."
