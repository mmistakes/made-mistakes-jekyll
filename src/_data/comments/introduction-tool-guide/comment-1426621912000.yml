message: "Probably not the answer you want to hear but if you want to spend the
  money on an expensive Bluetooth stylus give the Pogo Connect a try. It is the only
  stylus I know of that has a dedicated **undo** button supported by Paper.\r\n\r\nI
  do know where you're coming from. I absolutely hated the Rewind gesture when I first
  used Paper. Once I got over trying to second guess it and follow through with the
  gesture it started working better for me. A few years later and I have almost no
  problem using it now.\r\n\r\nThe speed at which you make the circular gesture and
  the amount of fingers you use makes a big difference. Sometimes you'll notice it
  drawing on screen instead of undoing, but if you continue with the motion it fixes
  itself. The Blend feature works that way too.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be some sort
  of **auto-correct** going on in the software that tries to fix mistakes, but it only
  figures that out after the fact. Learning to trust that it will do the right thing
  can help."
