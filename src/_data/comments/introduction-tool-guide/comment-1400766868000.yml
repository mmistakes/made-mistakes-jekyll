message: "Okay, so this is a rank beginner asking, but I cannot find out how to
  control (ie, access and use) Rewind. It pops up sporadically in the middle of the
  page but I can't seem to choose it even then. And how do I get to it when I want
  it?\r\n\r\nOh, and Zoom is the same thing--HOW do I get to it? Sorry, but this has
  been a real trial, and I do feel like I have some basic familiarity with apps like
  this.\r\n\r\n>(I am using Paper with the Pencil stylus, but am having problems with
  Rewind and Zoom both with my fingers and Pencil.)\r\n\r\nThanks for help with this;
  can't seem to find any of this REALLY basic stuff on any of the Paper Fifty Three
  pages"
