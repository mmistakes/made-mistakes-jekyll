message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea shell \r\nand gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never \r\nwants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but \r\nI had to tell someone!\r\n\r\nAlso visit my website: [lasertest](http://rdh7kq5jdd8qaz9yj6rv.com/ \"lasertest\")"
