message: "Thanks Josh. I came across those as well in my search but since I don't have any experience with AWS I passed them over. Definitely seem like good options though, especially if you're hosting with AWS.\r\n\r\nAs far as stats. I launched static comments in mid-August, looking at my crawl stats there isn't much that jumps out to me. Kilobytes downloaded seems to be trending up but hard to tell.\r\n\r\n![Made Mistakes crawl stats](https://mademistakes.com/assets/images/crawl-stats.png)\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed is the need for better comment spam filtering. I get around 1-3 submitted comments a day that are clearly spammers trying to get backlinks. Back with Disqus I got zero, so it must have been doing a good job of filtering that junk out.\r\n\r\nNot entirely sure if its bot driven or not but thinking if Staticman adds [support for ReCaptcha](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/20), that might help combat it."
