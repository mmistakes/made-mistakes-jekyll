message: "Michael. Then, it seems a bit easy but real situation is that I am hosting my website on Github, at least for the time being. So, I do not find Staticman helpful enough because it needs  `_config.yml` file to work. I may use Staticman in future when I change my host.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, for the help."
