  **Thanks for the update.** I have been meaning to bother you with a couple of
  questions but been hesitant about it for obvious reasons. I am still not sure
  if I should attempt a conversation that will probably never end! However,
  initially , I am just looking for some advice. But first, let me read your
  latest post first. I will continue my nervous babbling there.
