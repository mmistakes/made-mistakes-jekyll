  This code has been a terrific help to me for a site I'm working on... but I'm
  having quite a time trying to sort my comments by the date. `{% raw %}{% assign
  comments = site.data.comments[page.slug] | sort: "date" %}{% endraw %}` is throwing an
  error to the effect that there's no implicit conversion of String into
  Integer. My filenames aren't going to be guaranteed sequential, so sorting by
  those won't work... any idea what might be going wrong here?
