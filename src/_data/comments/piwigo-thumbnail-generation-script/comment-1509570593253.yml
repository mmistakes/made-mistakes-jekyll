message: "Thanks for the inspiration. I found the reason for the stretched pictures (I think), For each picture there is a value in the database that tells if the image is rotated or not. I assume this is used for setting the image attributes where the image is displayed. This is set when the thumbnail is generated, so if a thumbnail is generated by an external script and the image is rotated there will be a mismatch between images and database setting. I.e. the images will be in portrait mode, but the database thinks it is landscape. I solved this by letting Piwigo generate thumbnails for rotated images and this made all images look nice."
