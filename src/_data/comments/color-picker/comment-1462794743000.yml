message: "There isn't a quick way to import the colors. You essentially import the
  picture or grab it from [my Paper account](https://paper.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/1376457/standalone) and then you sample each of the colors
  with the Mixer tool. Once sampled you can drag the little circle into an empty spot
  in your palette.\r\n\r\n"
