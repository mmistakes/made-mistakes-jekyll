message: "I'm just coming back to Paper and things are markedly new and different.
  I'm very appreciative of your explanations and I'm finding your information very
  helpful. I downloaded your terrific portrait palette just now and I'm wondering
  how I should go about importing the colors to use in my own pictures?\r\n\r\nDo they replace
  the ones in the default palette or do I use the color pocket to sample them from
  another picture? I apologize if this is a question with an obvious answer â€“ I'm
  an absolute novice with the new innovations and I'm even having trouble navigating
  their info docs. Thanks!"
