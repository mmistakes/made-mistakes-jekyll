  It's 2017 now and I've been using Jekyll heavily for quite some time and using
  gulp (I even did some builds with webpack) but I'm really excited to see your
  deployment write-up and Travis CI.  Recently deployed with [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/#step-2-set-up-certificate-based-ssh-access-server-side)
  method and it worked but it basically caused a -rm -rf to my entire server
  because I fired my script at $HOME and that was a very bad day, so make sure
  you are specific when guiding people in these steps hah.
