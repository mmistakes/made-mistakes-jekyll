message: "No posts about how I'm doing it, but it's pretty easy to do if you're using Staticman to power your site's comments.\r\n\r\nBecause all my comments are stored in `.yml` files in the `_data` folder you can use the Liquid [`size` array filter](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/array-filters#size) to determine how many comments are in a particular post.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the [source of my site](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_includes/page-intro.html#L43-L45) you'll see this line which does just this:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% raw %}{{ site.data.comments[page.slug] | size }} Comment{% if site.data.comments[page.slug].size > 1 %}s{% endif %}{% endraw %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn [post listings](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_includes/entry.html#L39-L41) that loop over `site.posts` I modify it slightly to pull in `post.slug` instead of `page.slug` so it can grab the correct set of comments to count."
