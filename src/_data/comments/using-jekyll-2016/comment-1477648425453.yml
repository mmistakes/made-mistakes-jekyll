message: "Hi Michael.\r\n\r\nNice  article. But I've come to expect that from you. I've visited your site a few times. You've got Jekyll-y-goodness. Thanks. But this time I have a complaint. Yes.  You know what's about. It is about your latest \"theme\". I use \"theme\" loosely. Actually, it's not bad overall. But there is one horrendous element. You know what it is, don't you? But I am still going to say it. **For the love all things warm and fuzzy, please, Please, PLEASE ditch the linear gradients in the side column!!!** There.  I said it. I feel better. Like after a big pooh. Oh, what's that? Don't want long, weird comments like this, eh? Fair enough. Then don't assault our eyes. Tit for tat really. I look forward to not seeing those gradients. Ever. Unless I need to torture someone. Then I would use them. But I'd only do that for a good reason. A really good reason actually. Like to get nuclear shut down codes. Or stop the release of human-destroying virus. Or on people who use gradients like this. Thanks again, Michael. [Feel free to delete. Just laugh ... sort of. But seriously, ditch those diagonal gradients.]"
