message: "Hi Michael. \r\n\r\nNice  article.\r\n\r\nBut I've come to expect that from you.\r\n\r\nI've visited your site a few times.\r\n\r\nYou've got Jekyll-y-goodness.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nBut this time I have a complaint.\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nYou know what's about.\r\n\r\nIt is about your latest \"theme\".\r\n\r\nI use \"theme\" loosely.\r\n\r\nActually, it's not bad overall.\r\n\r\nBut there is one horrendous element.\r\n\r\nYou know what it is, don't you?\r\n\r\nBut I am still going to say it.\r\n\r\n**For the love all things warm and fuzzy, please, Please, PLEASE ditch the linear gradients in the side column!!!**\r\n\r\nThere. \r\n\r\nI said it.\r\n\r\nI feel better.\r\n\r\nLike after a big pooh.\r\n\r\nOh, what's that?\r\n\r\nDon't want long, weird comments like this, eh?\r\n\r\nFair enough.\r\n\r\nThen don't assault our eyes.\r\n\r\nTit for tat really.\r\n\r\nI look forward to not seeing those gradients.\r\n\r\nEver.\r\n\r\nUnless I need to torture someone.\r\n\r\nThen I would use them.\r\n\r\nBut I'd only do that for a good reason.\r\n\r\nA really good reason actually.\r\n\r\nLike to get nuclear shut down codes.\r\n\r\nOr stop the release of human-destroying virus.\r\n\r\nOr on people who use gradients like this.\r\n\r\nThanks again, Michael.\r\n\r\n[Feel free to delete. Just laugh ... sort of. But seriously, ditch those diagonal gradients.]"
