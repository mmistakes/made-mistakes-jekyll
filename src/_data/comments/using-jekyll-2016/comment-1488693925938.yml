message: "The problem as I see it is that when Jekyll started - you could simply install it on any OS and create some markdown and have your website.\r\n\r\n99.999% of what you've described on this page goes deeeeep into internals and configurations and stuff which are utterly undocumented and not for anyone who hasn't spent the past decade doing complex web development.\r\n\r\nJekyll really has shot itself in the foot with this stuff."
