message: "@Derek - The biggest impact on optimizing page speed for me was serving images responsibly and responsively where I could. That and making sure CSS and JS weren't blocking the rendering of each page, which meant inlining the critical bits into the  `<head>` element and using loadCSS to async the rest.\r\n\r\n2 seconds isn't bad at all for a build time. If you do see things slowing down here's a couple of bottlenecks I've discovered with large Jekyll sites:\r\n\r\n1. `for` loops. Try to limit them as they can really slow things down.\r\n2. Images and other large assets can become an IO issue since Jekyll copies all of them to the `_site` folder on each build. I've started using Gulp to do the copying and caching for me to avoid moving 1GB of images each build, which helped speed up things considerably.\r\n3. Using related posts with `lsi` enabled, while useful in displaying relevant content to improve user engagement, has a high cost on build times.\r\n\r\nI did some [rough build tests](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/issues/49) to get an idea of what was slowing things down for me. They're not all that scientific (ran each 3 times and averaged), but might give you some ideas if you're curious. The operating system and build of your computer also factor in. Found that macOS with an SSD performed slightly faster than a Windows PC with SSD."
