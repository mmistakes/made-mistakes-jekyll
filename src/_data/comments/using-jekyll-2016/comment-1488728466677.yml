message: "I agree a good chunk of this is really taking a deep dive into web development territory (asset management, critical path CSS, etc.), but you can't blame Jekyll for that. It makes absolutely no claims to support or do any of that out of the box. If anything it's a testament to its flexibility that it can be used in whatever way you want.\r\n\r\nIn the end Jekyll still takes your Markdown files and spits out `.html` files, nothing has changed there. About the only thing not really documented is the whole `_pages` thing. But the [liquid profiler](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/), [collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [`_data` files](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/), etc. all are if you take the time to dig into the documentation. I don't think it's fair to expect Jekyll to prescribe every way you can use these to build a site or app. \r\n\r\nThe way I'm using these features isn't necessarily how you or anyone else might want to. It's completely optional, which is one of the reasons I keep coming back to Jekyll to solve problems. It's not just a blog generator..."
