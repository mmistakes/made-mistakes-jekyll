message: "I really enjoyed reading your post, it has brought up issues that I should address earlier rather than later. I still have some time as I currently have only about 64 blog posts and takes about 2 seconds to generate. So, it is nowhere near the amount of posts (and build time) as yours.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the **You May Also Enjoy** module to provide readers with related content sounds great. And also featured posts. I'll be sure to add and try them out. Hopefully they won't slow the build times too much...\r\n\r\nThe point about having multiple `index.html` for different pages is spot-on, as I am someone who currently has that haha. It gets annoying pretty fast and will be taking your advice on using a `_pages/` directory to store those pages.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking into bumping my page speed from 67/100 to hopefully, 90s or high 90s such as yours.\r\n\r\nAlso didn't know about `_data/`, so similar to what you said, I was dumping most of my data into my config file... I suppose I haven't been utilizing YAML to its full extent. I have head, header, footer, foot HTML template files, but I feel your approach to using Liquid templates iterating through data objects would not only scale much nicer but feel more robust.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you for all the great tips and I look forward to reading more of your posts!"
