message: "Thanks for the awesome write-up! I used your themes as reference a lot
  when I was creating my own - yours were (and still are) some of the most complete
  and best documented out there.\r\n\r\nRegarding images, I use a slightly customized
  version of the jekyll-minimagick plugin to automatically generate multiple sizes
  of my images (thumb & small) for my webcomic theme. It sounds like it would
  do most of what you want."
