message: "Man, you are truly a treasure in the Jekyll world and more people should
  follow in your footsteps... to learn and to further leverage the possibilities of
  Jekyll. For me inspiration to redesign and recode my sites... probably with Skinny
  Bones. Thanks for all your efforts and mostly for the detail and passion that is
  always found in your code."
