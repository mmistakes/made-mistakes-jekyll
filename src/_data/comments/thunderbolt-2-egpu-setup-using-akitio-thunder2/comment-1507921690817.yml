message: "|- Hi Roy  Glad you find the guide helpful! It is not possible to use the AKiTiO Thunder2 Quad for eGPU, it is only for storage. I would recommend getting two AKiTiO Thunder2 PCIe enclosures since they are cheap. You can also opt for the Sonnet Echo Express SE II for about the same price as two AKiTiOs which does have 2 PCIe slots for graphics cards, but I did have some issues with the Sonnet back when I ran it with Windows 7 BIOS. If I used it today with Windows 10 UEFI I might have had a better experience with it.  &#47;Poul"
