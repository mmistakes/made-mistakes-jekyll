message: "Hi,  \nThis blog is awesome!\n\nI'm just wondering about setting up a DIY evga configuration for my macbook late 2013. I have a few questions:  \n1. Does it works with Windows 10 ?  \n2. I have my bootcamp uefi partition configured with Nvidia drivers installed which i use for my work..should i Perform a fresh windows installation? I hope no cause i don't wanna loose my applications..it could be a waste of time  \n3. Is this configuration plug and play? I suppose it is but please just give me your feedback about this point\n\nThank you for attention,best regard"
