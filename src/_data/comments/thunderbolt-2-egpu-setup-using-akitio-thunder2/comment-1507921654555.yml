message: "Hi Owen\n\nSorry for the late reply, I just got back from vacation! \n\nThe only thing I noticed is that loading a lot of textures is slower using eGPU systems because of the lower bandwidth, but that is really minor. Are you using an external monitor setup of internal? I have sometimes notices lower frame rates using the internal screen but I solved this by using an OPTIMUS boot file, see this guide [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/6727-guide-macbook-enabling-optimus-internal-lcd-mode/). Since then I have not experienced any problems with slowdowns.\n\nThe above also solved my few rare \"blank\" screen problems on boot which are similar to yours. It is worth a try in my opinion.\n\n&#47;Poul"
