message: "Hi Owen\n\nSorry for the late reply, I just got back from vacation! \n\nThe only thing I noticed is that loading a lot of textures is slower using eGPU systems because of the lower bandwidth, but that is really minor. Are you using an external monitor setup of internal? I have sometimes notices lower frame rates using the internal screen but I solved this by using an OPTIMUS boot file, see this guide <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;6727-guide-macbook-enabling-optimus-internal-lcd-mode&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>. Since then I have not experienced any problems with slowdowns.\n\nThe above also solved my few rare \"blank\" screen problems on boot which are similar to yours. It is worth a try in my opinion.\n\n&#47;Poul"
