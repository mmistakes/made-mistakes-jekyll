message: "Hi,  \nFirst of all thanks for the great instructions! :-) I built an eGPU with the following components:  \n- EVGA GTX980 SC ACX2.0, Akitio Thunder2 + powered rise, Sharkoon silentstorm 450W PSU\n-MacMini2012 and MacBookAir2013 (both with Thunderbolt 1)\n\nEverything seemed to work from the first try! However:  \n- OS X: rendering (e.g. Blender, Octane) no problems  \n- OS X: 3D tests (e.g. Heaven, Valley) crash the GPU almost right away.  \n- Windows 8.1/10: same as above.\n\nI can solve the crashing in Windows by underclocking the GPU by 150-200Mhz (EVGA Precision tool) Everything is stable after that and there are no crashes. Most games work at 1080p with high/max details at 30-60fps even with Thunderbolt 1! :-)\n\nCould the reason for crashing be that I'm using only Thunderbolt1? Or that the power through the riser is not stable enough?\n\nI would really like use the GPU on OS X side as well. Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!"
