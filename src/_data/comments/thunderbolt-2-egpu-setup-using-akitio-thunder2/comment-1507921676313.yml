message: "Hi Vikramjit\r\n\r\nYes it is possible with the correct hardware. Take a look at my post [here](/projects/external-graphics-card-egpu/) that explains the requirements to use the internal screen of the laptop. To sum it up, the recommended way and the most popular is to have a Optimus enabled laptop and a NVIDIA graphics card. There are other ways of getting it to work, but I have not tried this myself, but check out [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/2324-lucidlogix-virtu-internal-lcd-mode-for-amd-egpus/#comment-37598) post where you can use third party software for getting AMD graphics cards to work using the internal screen.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
