message: "|- Hi Vikramjit  Yes it is possible with the correct hardware. Take a look at my post <a href="https:&#47;&#47;odd-one-out.serek.eu&#47;external-graphics-card-egpu&#47;" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a> that explains the requirements to use the internal screen of the laptop. To sum it up, the recommended way and the most popular is to have a Optimus enabled laptop and a NVIDIA graphics card. There are other ways of getting it to work, but I have not tried this myself, but check out <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;2324-lucidlogix-virtu-internal-lcd-mode-for-amd-egpus&#47;#comment-37598" rel="nofollow">this<&#47;a> post where you can use third party software for getting AMD graphics cards to work using the internal screen.  &#47;Poul"
