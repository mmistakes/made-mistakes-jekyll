message: "|- hi poul,  I wanted to know if it works on asus rog g751 with windows 10 (1607) 64 bit with gpu external as GTX970 or GTX1060&#47;1070? and there would be a better performance a GTX965M 2gb for play game in ultra graphics setting on the laptop screen with thunderbolt 2 ?  because I would love to play with ultra setting in game with external gpu on my laptop once at home ^^ (not possible with my current gtx965m 2gb of my laptop)  and I wonder if it will work and if it is really worth, because if performance is less good as with my current GTX965M 2gb it is useless buying stuff...  thank you for all that informations"
