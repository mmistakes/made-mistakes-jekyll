message: "'Just bought me an AkiTiO Thunder2 + Asus GTX 960 2gb and going to add a PSU and do the ''''paperclip'''' trick. My question is: Am i going to need a riser? What kind of PSU W do you recommend?<br &#47;><br &#47;>I got a Macbook pro 13'''' mid 2014 and will this work with windows 7 through bootcamp? I don''t want to buy win 8 &#47; 8.1 because I don''t like the UI and I want to save some money.. The best would if I only used OS X but seems a little complicated to make it work perfectly. And I want to use the internal retina display. <br &#47;><br &#47;>I would be glad to hear your thoughts about this and maybe some tips and tricks! Thanks!'"
