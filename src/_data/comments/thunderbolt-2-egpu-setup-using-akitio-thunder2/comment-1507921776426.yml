message: "Hi Blaster\r\n\r\nTake a look at my post [here](/projects/external-graphics-card-egpu/) about what NVIDIA Optimus is. As far as I known the internal monitor needs to be connected directly to the iGPU from intel and not to the dGPU as in the g751. Battery Boost as far as I can see is a technology that limits the frame-rate of a game to preserve battery-life. If the frame-rate is low enough just to use the iGPU it can use Optimus to switch to the lower power iGPU. But as far as I know the g751 series does not even have an iGPU, only the NVIDIA card, hence no Optimus.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
