message: "|- Hi Martin  You should see a huge improvement in frame rate, you are comparing a mobile graphics card to a desktop version. Just take a look <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gpu.userbenchmark.com&#47;Compare&#47;Nvidia-GTX-980-Ti-vs-Nvidia-GTX-880M&#47;3439vsm8540" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a>. And the performance hit for Thunderbolt 2 type setups are minimal as you can see <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techpowerup.com&#47;reviews&#47;NVIDIA&#47;GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling&#47;3.html" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a>.  You might want to wait and get the GTX 1080 which is out very soon.  &#47;Poul"
