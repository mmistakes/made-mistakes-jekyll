message: "I really appreciate the guide. Can you explain why you used a powered riser? Are you just using it for stability or does the card need the extra power? Also, if I didn't use a riser and just directly put a half length GPU in it, would I run into any problems as long as I plug in the 8 pin connector to a PSU?"
