message: "Hi Evan\n\nI would recommend making one yourself from the previous link I supplied, just make sure that you get the cabling right. You can buy them from eBay or other sites, but the feedback I have seen is that they do not always fit and they are a bit expensive. I have not found a good reliable source for these barrel plug adapters to recommend...\n\n/Poul"
