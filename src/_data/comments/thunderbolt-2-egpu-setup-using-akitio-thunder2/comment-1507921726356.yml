message: "|- Hi Evan  I would recommend making one yourself from the previous link I supplied, just make sure that you get the cabling right. You can buy them from eBay or other sites, but the feedback I have seen is that they do not always fit and they are a bit expensive. I have not found a good reliable source for these barrel plug adapters to recommend...  &#47;Poul"
