message: "I'm having trouble getting it to work today and it's really bothering me. Worked just fine for 3 days and now all it will do is hang at the fucking windows screen with the rotating dots. I've tried booting it up in various configurations for hours and making sure everything is seated correctly but no dice and i don't understand. I also don't get why the akitio box will flash blue saying there's a connection but the MacBook itself won't turn on. Any advice will be greatly appreciated because i am really frustrated with this all right now."
