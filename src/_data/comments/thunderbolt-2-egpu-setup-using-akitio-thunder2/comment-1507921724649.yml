message: ""Poul,\n\nThank you again for all answering everyone on the message board here including myself. \n\nQuick question, if i do not want to use a Riser will i need to get a barrel plug like this\nhttps:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Extra-6-Pin-2-1mm-Barrel-Gridseed&#47;dp&#47;B00KB3R8YM?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=6%20pin%20to%20barrel&amp;qid=1464320916&amp;ref_=sr_1_5&amp;sr=8-5\n\nMy understanding is that i cannot power the akitio with its power supply and power the GPU with the PSU. Both need to be on the same power source. is this correct?\n\nThanks again in advance""
