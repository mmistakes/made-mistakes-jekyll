message: "Hi Tom\n\nSounds about right, it is around 15% for Thunderbolt 2 and around 5% for Thunderbolt 3. It depends also on resolution, the higher the resolution the lower the performance hit. Some games are prone to a higher loss than others. If you use the internal monitor you will get a higher performance hit since you are using some of the bandwidth for the signal back to the laptop. I recommend you take a look at <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techpowerup.com&#47;reviews&#47;NVIDIA&#47;GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling&#47;1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<&#47;a> article which is the most comprehensive test I have seen on effects of bandwidth starvation in graphic cards. \n\n&#47;Poul"
