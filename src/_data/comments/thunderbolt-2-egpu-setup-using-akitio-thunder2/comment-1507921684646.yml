message: "Hi Marquis\n\nYou can't, you need to modify the AKiTiO Thunder 2, fit the whole thing into an existing PC case or do as me and built an exeskeleton case using OpenBeam as described [here](/projects/egpu-case-built-around-akitio-thunder-2-and-sonnet-echo-express-se-ii/). I have since that post removed the Sonnet Echo Express SE II and made the whole setup smaller. Some have had success fitting a smaller card in the box, but these cards are limited in power.\n\n/Poul"
