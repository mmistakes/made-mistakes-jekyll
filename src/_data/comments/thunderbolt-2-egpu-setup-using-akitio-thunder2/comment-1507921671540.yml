message: ""Hum..sounds interesting but i m so sure it s gonna  be a little expensive! Btw just one point i didn t completely understand: why we should pick up EVGA cards only? Probably for the highest chipset compatibily? Because Apple itself mounts this kind of cards on our macs? I ve found a beautiful PNY GTX 970 for 300 &euro; and i was thinking about it..the price sounds good but i don t want to waste my money! \n\nThank you again and have a nice weekend :)""
