message: "Hi Kevin\r\n\r\nThe best performance would be to directly attach the display to the eGPU setup like I have. I still only use a single cable from the laptop, but use a Thunderbolt dock to attach my mouse and keyboard:\r\n\r\nMacBook --> eGPU --> External monitor (through HDMI / display port) --> Thunderbolt docking station\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the Cinema Display can do this, but not the newer Thunderbolt displays, check out [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/4116-thunderbolt-egpu-with-thunderbolt-display/) post. But worst case is that you use Optimus to the Thunderbolt attached display, but you will get a performance hit since display data takes away some bandwidth. You should ask around at [TechInferno](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) just to be sure, but it should work.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
