message: "|- Hi Kevin  The best performance would be to directly attach the display to the eGPU setup like I have. I still only use a single cable from the laptop, but use a Thunderbolt dock to attach my mouse and keyboard:  MacBook --> eGPU --> External monitor (through HDMI &#47; display port) --> Thunderbolt docking station  As far as I know the Cinema Display can do this, but not the newer Thunderbolt displays, check out <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;4116-thunderbolt-egpu-with-thunderbolt-display&#47;" rel="nofollow">this<&#47;a> post. But worst case is that you use Optimus to the Thunderbolt attached display, but you will get a performance hit since display data takes away some bandwidth. You should ask around at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;83-diy-e-gpu-projects&#47;" rel="nofollow">TechInferno<&#47;a> just to be sure, but it should work.  &#47;Poul"
