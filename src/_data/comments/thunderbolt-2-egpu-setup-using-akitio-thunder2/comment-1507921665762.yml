message: "|- Hi  Glad that you can at least get it working in Windows. It seems to me that the setup is not getting enough power since you can underclock the setup and run stable. The 450W PSU should be more than enough and you use a powered riser, at least on paper. The PSU is also single rail so there should not be a problem overloading a rail. According to the PSU specs it can deliver 324 watts of power on the 12V rail. As far as I can see the GTX 980 from EVGA you have has 2 6-pin connecters (75 watts each, total 150 watts) + the 75 watts from the PCIe port = 225 watts. So again we should not have a problem here.  My mind comes back to the powered PCIe riser. Lets assume it does not supply any additional power, then we have 150 watts from the two 6-pin connecters and 25 watts from the AKiTiO Thunder2 box for a total of 175 watts. This is actually 10 watts short of the maximum power draw according to EVGA which is 185 watts.  So to stop my rant and answer your questions :)  Using Thunderbolt 1 should not have any impact, only slower performance. I use Thunderbolt 1 on my old laptop without any problems. I think it has something to do with the power, more specifically the from the PCIe riser. Which riser are you using?  &#47;Poul"
