message: ""Hi again,\nAll of my parts recently arrived, the same ones you used bar the psu which is a corsair cx430m. I assembled the setup following your guide and ran into some difficulty. \n\nThe evga 970 fans don't spin when the psu is powered up, which they should? The mac isn't detecting the 970 either so it seems that power is an issue. The green light is lit on the akitio box, so the riser appears to work. \n\nI done some troubleshooting and found these results. My psu has one dedicated pcie power cable, and I used a two molex to pcie and a two sata to pcie with no luck. \n\nThe 970 fans still didn't spin when connected to my pc power supply which I know works with my 7950, which also uses two 6 pins. But the card works when used in my tower, via my motherboard pcie slot. \n\nI was thinking it might be the psu but using the molex powered riser from the corsair psu and two 6 pins from my pc psu, it failed to get the fans going. \n\nAny ideas what might be happening? \nThanks, Owen""
