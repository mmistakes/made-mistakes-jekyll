message: "Hi Isaac\n\nIt should work fine with any laptop having a thunderbolt 1 or 2 connection. I have successfully used my old Lenovo ThinkPad T430s with this setup (thunderbolt 1). You might run into some issues if you use Windows 7 installed as BIOS as I have described in my previous posts, installing Windows 8+ using (U)EFI just makes everything a whole lot easier.\n\nThe power supply should be fine, it has a single PCIe connector which you need to power the GTX 960. However, since the GTX 960 only has a single 6pin PCIe connector (according to the tech specs <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;us.msi.com&#47;product&#47;vga&#47;GTX-960-2GD5T-OC.html#hero-specification\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>) and the AKiTiO Thunder2 is limited to 25 watt from the PCIe port, you only have 75 + 25 = 100 watts total to power your card. Most posts on the internet agree that you need at least 125 watts of power as described <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.guru3d.com&#47;articles-pages&#47;msi-geforce-gtx-960-gaming-oc-review,7.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>. \n\nTherefore you need to buy a powered molex PCIe riser to be able to supply up to 75 watts on the PCIe port on the AKiTiO Thunder2 which would bring the total up to a safe 150 watts. The ones I use and recommend can be bought <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.moddiy.com&#47;products&#47;PCI%252dExpress-PCI%252dE-8X-to-16X-Riser-Card-Flexible-Ribbon-Extender-Cable-w%7B47%7DMolex-%252b-Solid-Capacitor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>.\n\nYou can also find similar items on Amazon (search for \"pcie riser powered capacitor\"), but the quality might vary. If you don't follow my recommendation then at least make sure that the riser:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is x8 or x16 to x16<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Is powered (molex)<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Has a capacitor<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Has good reviews<&#47;li>\n<&#47;ul>\n\nAnd lastly you will need a paperclip :)\n\n&#47;Poul"
