message: "Hi Michael\n\nCan you confirm that you have done the \"sudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\" and that\n\n/System/Library/Extensions/NVDAStartup.kext  \n/System/Library/Extensions/IONDRVSupport.kext  \n/System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleHDAController.kext\n\nContains\n\n`<key>IOPCITunnelCompatible</key>`  \n`<true/>`\n\nthe correct places? I just want to be sure. Without this the eGPU will not work at all. And try to use the Kext utility to be 100% sure that the Kext files are rebuilt. The \"found_hardware = 0\" to \"found_hardware = 1\" line should not be a problem since you did install the drivers\n\n/Poul"
