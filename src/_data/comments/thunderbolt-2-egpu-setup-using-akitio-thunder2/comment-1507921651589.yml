message: "Hi Dimitri\r\n\r\nI have not seen any eGPU builds using the new 15 inch rMBP yet, see [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/8080-guide-make-new-2015-mbprs-with-amd-gpu-compatible-with-an-e-gpu-provisional/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3bfo30/egpu_for_the_macbook_pro_15_mid_2015/) link.\r\n\r\nI am sure someone will find a solution soon, but until then I would recommend waiting buying the eGPU parts. And it might not support Optimus since the new Macbook contains an AMD graphics card so getting the eGPU to work using the internal screen might prove to be more difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nBut keep following the techinferno eGPU forums for any success [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/).\r\n\r\n/Poul"
