message: "I am desperately trying to find a way to play PC games using my Macbook Pro Retina 13\" via Parrells. I have 2 tabs open on Chrome: 1 on Newegg for building yet another gaming PC (not ideal) and this page on building an external GPU unit.\n\nMy question is, will I be able to game once again with my Macbook, this frankenstein'ed device, and a GPU?"
