message: "Hi Fahim\n\nThe power supply might be the issue, it is not a quality brand name and I even had to google it to look it up. If it is from the value series it might not be able to deliver stable power, take a look <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.xbitlabs.com&#47;articles&#47;cases&#47;display&#47;aerocool-psu_3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>. If have helped another reader where the instability was solved by using a brand name PSU like Seasonic, Corsair, EVGA etc. \n\nThe riser might also be the problem, but instability issues are almost always tied the the PSU &#47; PCIe riser.\n\n&#47;Poul"
