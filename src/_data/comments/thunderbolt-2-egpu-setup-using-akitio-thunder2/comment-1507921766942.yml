message: "Hi Fahim\n\nThe power supply might be the issue, it is not a quality brand name and I even had to google it to look it up. If it is from the value series it might not be able to deliver stable power, take a look [here](http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cases/display/aerocool-psu_3.html). If have helped another reader where the instability was solved by using a brand name PSU like Seasonic, Corsair, EVGA etc.\n\nThe riser might also be the problem, but instability issues are almost always tied the the PSU / PCIe riser.\n\n/Poul"
