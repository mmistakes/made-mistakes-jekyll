message: "Hi Shahrookh\n\nNo, you need a Thunderbolt port for this to work. But depending on what ports you do have you can built a similar system. Take a look at my post [here](/projects/external-graphics-card-egpu/) and scroll down to \"PCIe enclosure\". Something like the Bplus PE4L can use an Express card or mini PCIe slot. It is only a quarter of the bandwidth but plenty of horsepower. This is what I did in my post [here](/projects/external-graphics-card-experiment-part-1/) where you do not need the Express Card to Thunderbolt adapter.\n\n/Poul"
