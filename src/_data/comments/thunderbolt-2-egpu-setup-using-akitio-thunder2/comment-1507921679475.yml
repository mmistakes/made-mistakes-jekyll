message: "|- Hi Shahrookh  No, you need a Thunderbolt port for this to work. But depending on what ports you do have you can built a similar system. Take a look at my post <a href="https:&#47;&#47;odd-one-out.serek.eu&#47;external-graphics-card-egpu&#47;" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a> and scroll down to "PCIe enclosure". Something like the Bplus PE4L can use an Express card or mini PCIe slot. It is only a quarter of the bandwidth but plenty of horsepower. This is what I did in my post <a href="https:&#47;&#47;odd-one-out.serek.eu&#47;external-graphics-card-experiment-part-1&#47;" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a> where you do not need the Express Card to Thunderbolt adapter.  &#47;Poul"
