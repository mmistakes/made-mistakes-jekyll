message: "Hi Evan\n\nNo problem, I am happy to help and share what I know! I would always recommend using a single power supply to power the whole setup, so without a powered riser you would need to use a barrel plug. Take a look at [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/6543-guide-making-a-molex-to-barrel-adapter/) post. But using two separate power supplies, the one from AKiTiO Thunder2 and a normal ATX power supply should be just fine, I just would not recommend it. Some are doing it just like that, take a look [here](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/diy-egpu-for-mac-mini-2012-osx.1772495/)\n\n/Poul"
