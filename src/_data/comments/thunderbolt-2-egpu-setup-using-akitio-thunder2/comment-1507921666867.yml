message: "Hi,\n\nI also assume it's something to do with the power or I might have a faulty GPU. There has been some cases of faulty EVGA cards with similar symptoms and replacing the card has solved the issues (or under clocking it to factory speeds), however I don't have a PC around I could test whether the GPU is at fault. I have another powered riser (1x to 16x) and the GPU also crashes with that under load although it seems that the 16x-16x riser takes a bit longer to crash.\n\nThe riser I'm using is a 16x to 16x powered molex riser ([http://www.dx.com/p/pci-e-16x-to-16x-riser-card-extender-ribbon-cable-w-molex-connector-black-grey-23cm-304484]())\n\nI'm thinking that the power/voltage the GPU is getting through the riser is not stable enough and/or the GPU is very sensitive to the voltage/power its getting and shuts itself down under load.\n\nI could of course create a custom under clocked BIOS and flash the GPU. Then it would most likely work without crashing in OS X too. Anyways I'm glad I can render without problems in OS X and play games (with the under clocking) in windows! :-)\n\nNow I'm just waiting for this to come available so I can put all the components in a nice case:  \n[https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php]()\n\nThanks for the reply!\n\nJ"
