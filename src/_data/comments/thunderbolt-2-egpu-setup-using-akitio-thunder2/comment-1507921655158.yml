message: "Hi Paul,\n\nHope you had a good vacation! It turns out there was a software problem somewhere along the line, a fresh 8.1 install solved my problems! \n\nHowever, I tried putting my setup sprawl into a case, and something must have broken because it's no longer working. The blue light will come on when my MacBook boots, but the fans will wobble every 7/8 seconds and not register the egpu with my Mac like it used to, which bugs me as it was all working fine! \n\nThanks again, Owen"
