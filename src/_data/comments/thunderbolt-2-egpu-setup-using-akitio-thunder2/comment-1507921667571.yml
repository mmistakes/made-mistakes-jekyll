message: "Hi again\n\nThe PCIe riser looks fine and of high quality. Other than swapping out components or trying in a PC build as you suggested, I don't see what else you can do. You could talk to EVGA directly and RMA the GPU. They were willing to swap my card because of some coil whine, but it is a shot in the dark.\n\nBy the way, the case you are waiting for looks really nice! I might upgrade to this case myself.\n\n/Poul"
