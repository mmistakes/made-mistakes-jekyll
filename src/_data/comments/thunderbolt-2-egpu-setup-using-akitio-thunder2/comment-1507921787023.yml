message: "Hi Niko\n\nIt depends, if the card can get enough power through the 6pin / 8 pin connecters + the 25 watts of power through the AKiTiO Thunder2. I always recommend a powered PCIe riser to be sure not to run into any power issues, but often it is not needed. The added benefit of using a powered riser is that you do not need to use the power brick from the AKiTiO Thunder2.\n\n/Poul"
