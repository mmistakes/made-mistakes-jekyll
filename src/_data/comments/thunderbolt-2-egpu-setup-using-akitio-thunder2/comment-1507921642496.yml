message: "|- Hi Poul, I will try that tomorrow. You said you are also using a thunderbolt dock. Is it plugged in when you start your macbook, do you plug it in when the boot option menu comes up or do you hotplug it?  Just for fun I hotplugged the Elgato thunderbolt dock in and as a result the fan of the akitio box turned up, which didn't turn at all with my Belkin dock plugged it...  Carl"
