message: "Hi Poul, \nI will try that tomorrow. You said you are also using a thunderbolt dock. Is it plugged in when you start your macbook, do you plug it in when the boot option menu comes up or do you hotplug it?\n\nJust for fun I hotplugged the Elgato thunderbolt dock in and as a result the fan of the akitio box turned up, which didn't turn at all with my Belkin dock plugged it...\n\nCarl"
