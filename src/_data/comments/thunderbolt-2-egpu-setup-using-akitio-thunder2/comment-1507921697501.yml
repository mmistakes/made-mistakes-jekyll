message: "Hi Evan\n\nIt depends on your needs. I use the GTX 970 myself and think it hits a sweet spot between price and performance. If you need to game at 4K resolutions and you can afford it you should take a look at GTX 980 ti which has more VRAM and horsepower. But since the next generation of NVIDIA cards might be out later this year, I would still go for the GTX 970 FTW and wait to see if you can get better single GPU 4K performance.\n\n/Poul"
