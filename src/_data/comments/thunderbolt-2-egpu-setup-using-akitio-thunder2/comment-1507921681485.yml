message: "Hi Michael\n\nAccording to this [page](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-980/specifications) a reference GTX 980 have 2 6 pin connectors that supplies 75watts each and the PCIe port itself can supply another 75watts = 225watt. Add another 25% as we don't like running a power supply fully loaded = 270 watt. Round up to 300 watts and that is you target for how much the power supply should be able to deliver on the 12v rail. Since not all power from a power supply is 12v, you should aim for a 400 - 500 watt quality power supply or higher.\n\n/Poul"
