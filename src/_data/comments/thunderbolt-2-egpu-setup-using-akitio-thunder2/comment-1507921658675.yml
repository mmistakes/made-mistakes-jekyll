message: "Thank you very much for your answer! When I connect the monitor (via HDMI or Displayport) directly to the GTX970, my monitor says \"No signal\". Yes, I have done something similar. When I modified the nvidia driver, I just removed this line \"if (!validateHardware()) return false;\" from the  distribution file and the driver successfully installed. But I have not replaced \"found_hardware = 0\" to \"found_hardware = 1\" I made changes to the thunderbolt as specified in this video http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=QfKb8TcHDkI&amp;list=FL_7TDIRm1TbEyjRDA7vxl1A&amp;index=5 (5:20) and it is very similar to what is written here http:&#47;&#47;www.journaldulapin.com&#47;2014&#47;12&#47;04&#47;a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite&#47; But in the end I did not use Kext Utility. I just made the team in the terminal \"sudo kextcache -system-caches\". Maybe that's the problem? I have not updated yosemite. Here pictures about my system https:&#47;&#47;www.dropbox.com&#47;sh&#47;ulo34t8itmk1w8u&#47;AAAOEiptFOOAS8KMXjSPXT8na?dl=0 Thank you very much for your help"
