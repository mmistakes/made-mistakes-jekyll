message: "Thank you very much for your answer! When I connect the monitor (via HDMI or Displayport) directly to the GTX970, my monitor says \"No signal\".  \nYes, I have done something similar. When I modified the nvidia driver, I just removed this line \"if (!validateHardware()) return false;\" from the  distribution file and the driver successfully installed. But I have not replaced \"found_hardware = 0\" to \"found_hardware = 1\" I made changes to the thunderbolt as specified in this video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfKb8TcHDkI&list=FL_7TDIRm1TbEyjRDA7vxl1A&index=5]() (5:20) and it is very similar to what is written here [http://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/12/04/a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite/]()  \nBut in the end I did not use Kext Utility. I just made the team in the terminal \"sudo kextcache -system-caches\". Maybe that's the problem? I have not updated yosemite. Here pictures about my system [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ulo34t8itmk1w8u/AAAOEiptFOOAS8KMXjSPXT8na?dl=0]()  \nThank you very much for your help"
