message: "|- Hi Chingheav  Assuming everything is set up correctly, you can go into the NVIDIA control panel and set the preferred GPU to the GTX 980ti. This works for me, but I only have a single discrete GPU. Since you have two discrete GPS, the internal GTX 775M and the external GTX980ti I am not sure how this works. You might try disabling the GTX 775M if it does not work.  &#47;Poul"
