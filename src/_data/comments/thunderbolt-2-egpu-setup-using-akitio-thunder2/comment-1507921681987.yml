message: "Hello! I've gotten this working with a Quadro K2200 card. My only issues is I need to have a monitor plugged into the card for my system to recognize it. Did you get this to work without plugging a monitor into the graphics card?\n\nWhen I don't have a monitor plugged into the graphics card and go to the Nvidia control panel-no options show up. Thanks a lot!"
