message: "Hi Marc\n\nUsing any graphic card in Parallels or any other virtualisation software will have a huge performance impact with newer games. If its about old games (DX9) then the performance hit is non existing. See [this](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/benchmarking-parallels-fusion-and-virtualbox-against-boot-camp) post for more. You are looking for PCI passthrough with graphics cards like described [here](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Multi-headed-VMWare-Gaming-Setup-564/), but is is a difficult path with the correct combination of hardware and software.\n\nFor this setup to work, you need to have Windows installed as Bootcamp for best performance and the ability to use the internal monitor of the laptop with the eGPU. \n\nIf you connect your Macbook Pro Retina to an external monitor then the setup will also work using this setup in OS X, but only the external monitor can use the graphics card. Then you might be able to ditch parallels and install PC games via Wine. I myself have installed the PC version of the Steam client so I can play PC only games using OS X. That should be able to take advantage of external graphics card. If I have time I will try to benchmark the difference using Wine and Steam later this weekend.\n\nTo sum it up, if you are willing to install Windows (UEFI) using Bootcamp then it will work. I use it myself to play PC games with almost no performance hit. And I am pretty sure that the setup will work using OS X and an external monitor (read more [](/projects/external-graphics-card-egpu/))\n\n/Poul"
