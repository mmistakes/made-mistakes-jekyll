message: "Hi Art\n\nIf you use an external monitor and Windows it should work. The AMD cards cannot use the internal monitor as far as I know, not in any easy way. Since it is an all in one desktop you will want to use the internal monitor and for this I would ask around at <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;83-diy-e-gpu-projects&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;83-diy-e-gpu-projects&#47;<&#47;a> since I dont have any experience getting with AMD cards and internal monitors. \n\n&#47;Poul"
