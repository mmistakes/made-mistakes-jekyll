message: "Hi Art\n\nIf you use an external monitor and Windows it should work. The AMD cards cannot use the internal monitor as far as I know, not in any easy way. Since it is an all in one desktop you will want to use the internal monitor and for this I would ask around at [https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) since I dont have any experience getting with AMD cards and internal monitors.\n\n/Poul"
