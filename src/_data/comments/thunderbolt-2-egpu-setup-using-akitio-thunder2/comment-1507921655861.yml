message: "Hi Owen\n\nHmmm, there are a few things you can try, but it sounds like a little bit of detective work might be needed :/ Could be a loose connection somewhere which breaks the PCI-E connection and / or power to the card.\n* Try using the other Thunderbolt port on the MacBook\n* Make sure the PCI-E riser is firmly attached to both the graphics card and AKiTiO Thunder2\n* Make sure the powered molex for the PCI-E riser is connected and all of the power connecters are connected to the graphics card\n* If using molex power adapters to giver power to your card, make sure not all of them are on the same PSU rail\n\n/Poul"
