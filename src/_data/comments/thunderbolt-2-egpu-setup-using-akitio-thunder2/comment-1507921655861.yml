message: ""Hi Owen\n\nHmmm, there are a few things you can try, but it sounds like a little bit of detective work might be needed :&#47; Could be a loose connection somewhere which breaks the PCI-E connection and &#47; or power to the card.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Try using the other Thunderbolt port on the MacBook<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Make sure the PCI-E riser is firmly attached to both the graphics card and AKiTiO Thunder2<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Make sure the powered molex for the PCI-E riser is connected and all of the power connecters are connected to the graphics card<&#47;li>\n\t<li>If using molex power adapters to giver power to your card, make sure not all of them are on the same PSU rail<&#47;li>\n<&#47;ul>\n\n&#47;Poul""
