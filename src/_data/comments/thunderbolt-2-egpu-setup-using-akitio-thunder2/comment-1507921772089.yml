message: "Hi,  \nim looking to do this Setup with my MacBook Pro Mid 2015 (Core i7-4870hq, 16GB RAM, AMD Radeon R9-M370X, 512GB SSD) runing Windows 10 (UEFI) over Bootcamp. The internal AMD Graphics Card does not have enough Power for Gaming on High Quality. Will this Setup work for me with a nVidia GTX 970/1070 Graphics Card? I Would prefer the use of the internal Monitor, but i don't have any Problems using an external Monitor if it will not work with the internal."
