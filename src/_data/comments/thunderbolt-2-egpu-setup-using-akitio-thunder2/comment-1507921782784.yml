message: "Hi Patrick\n\nI don't have my AKiTiO Thunder2 anymore so I do not know if it will fit. But if you take a look [here](http://www.evga.com/products/images/gallery/06G-P4-6163-KR_SM_6.jpg) you will see the 6-pin power connector at the top of the card which probably means you cannot fit the card and the connector with the lid closed.\n\n/Poul"
