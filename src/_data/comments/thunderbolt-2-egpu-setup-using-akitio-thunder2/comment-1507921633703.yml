message: "Hi Owen\n\nLets try a few things\n\n> The 970 fans still didn't spin when connected to my pc power supply which I know works with my 7950, which also uses two 6 pins. But the card works when used in my tower, via my motherboard pcie slot.\n\nDoes the card work in your tower using the PCIe riser? Then we can rule out the PCIe riser as the faulty part. Remember som PCIe risers needs to be firmly attached, I had similar problems when the PCIe riser was not firmly attached.\n\nAre you sure the blue light lights up on the AKiTiO box? Again, check that the PCIe riser is firmly attached and that the thunderbolt cable is attached to the AKiTiO box and laptop. Turn of the power from everything and then turn on the PSU first, then the laptop.\n\nDo the fan on the Corsair PSU spin when you use the paperclip trick and turn on the PSU? If not try to attach a small fan to see that the PSU is actually outputting some power\n\nDid you try to use your pc PSU with both the two 6 pins and the molex for the powered riser? \n\nAnd lastly, do you use the AKiTiO power supply or is it unplugged? \n\nCan you take a picture and post a link so I might see if anything is wrong?\n\n&#47;Poul"
