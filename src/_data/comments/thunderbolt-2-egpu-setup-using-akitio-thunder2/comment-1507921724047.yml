message: "Hi Sam\n\nIt should work just fine, but most cards will not fit in the AKiTiO case. You will need to purchase an external power supply and maybe a powered PCIe riser. You can always fit a card by taking the motherboard out from the AKiTiO Thunder 2 case. You can put the whole thing inside a small mini-itx case or make on yourself as I have done [here](/projects/egpu-case-built-around-akitio-thunder-2-and-sonnet-echo-express-se-ii/).\n\n/Poul"
