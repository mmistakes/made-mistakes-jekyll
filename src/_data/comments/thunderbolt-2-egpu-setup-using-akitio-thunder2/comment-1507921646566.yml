message: "1) Yes I can perform it without any problems with the dock disconnected. So I only get this problem when I connect the dock. \n\n2) I did already a DSDT override when I tried to get rid of the Code 12 error, but it didn't so I bought the DiY setup.\n\nFor me it's okay if you would post the problem on the forums."
