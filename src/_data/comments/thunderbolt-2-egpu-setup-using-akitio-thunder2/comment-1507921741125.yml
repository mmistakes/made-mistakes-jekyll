message: "Hey Poul, thanks for the great guide.  I am embarking on this quest currently, but made a mistake when ordering my pcie riser ( I think ).  Take a look at it here:  \n\nhttps:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00GUKRX6S&#47;ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n\nThis is the riser that Amazon claimed was frequently ordered along with the Akitio Thunder 2, and at first glanced it seemed to be good for the job.  However, upon setting everything up correctly, I was unable to get my GPU ( reference gtx 970 ) to power on properly.   I believe this is due to the riser only have a single power pin.  \n\nI have a decent understanding of electronics and how electricity works, and it seems logical that a riser with only a positive power pin would work correctly if the GPU was plugged into the same motherboard as the PSU,  because then you have a completed circuit.  \n\nHowever, when the GPU is plugged into the Akitio, and the riser has only a positive pin, there is no completed circuit, causing the GPU to be unable to be powered on.\n\nI ordered a new riser with two power pins, and I hope that this resolves the issue!"
