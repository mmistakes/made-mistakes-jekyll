message: "Hi Chris\r\n\r\nIt does look a bit strange. I use and recommend the PCIe risers from http://www.moddiy.com/products/PCI%252dExpress-PCI%252dE-8X-to-16X-Riser-Card-Flexible-Ribbon-Extender-Cable-w%7B47%7DMolex-%252b-Solid-Capacitor.html, they are inexpensive and good quality. Anyway, keeping my fingers crossed that it solves your problem!\r\n\r\n/Poul"
