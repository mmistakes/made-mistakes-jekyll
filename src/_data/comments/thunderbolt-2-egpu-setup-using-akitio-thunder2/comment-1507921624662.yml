message: "Hi Ruben\r\n\r\nSorry for the late answer, I was on vacation. Your shopping list looks fine. The power supply has more than enough power and the GTX 960 should be able to get you around 80-90% performance on average compared to a normal setup (see more [here](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling/3.html)). And you should be able to run this setup using OS X if you follow this guide:\r\nhttp://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/12/04/a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite/. I have confirmed it to be working on the previous version of OS X (Maverick), but have not yet tried using the above method on Yosemite. There is one limitation if you run this under OS X, you can only accelerate the external display, not the internal laptop display. You need Windows to do that trick and Optimus"
