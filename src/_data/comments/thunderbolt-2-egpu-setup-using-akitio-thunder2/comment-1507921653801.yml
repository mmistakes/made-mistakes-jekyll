message: ""Hi Poul,\n\nMy new evga 980ti superclocked card just arrived and got it all working with your guide, exactly the same way as the 970 I tried about 6 weeks back.\n\nAfter some use I noticed a couple of things. \n\nMy whole system seems a little sluggish while the egpu is plugged in, just little things like loading applications or the file explorers take longer than usual? This usually isn't a problem without the egpu.\n\nAnd sometimes when I go to start the setup and I power my mac on, everything starts to spin, but the laptop screen remains blank and doesn't chime at all. \n\nThis doesn't happen all the time but just wanted to see if there were any quick fixes or troubleshooting tips. \n\nAny help appreciated, thanks,\nOwen""
