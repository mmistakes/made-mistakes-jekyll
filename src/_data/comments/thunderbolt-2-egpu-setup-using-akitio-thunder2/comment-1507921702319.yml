message: "|- Hi Tom  It should just be fine with a quality 360 watt power supply. The recommended power supply is the total system including CPU, motherboard, harddisk and so on. The actual card is rated for 128 watt max, but take this with a grain of salt as cards can draw much more for shorter periods of time. But 360 watts should be plenty of power.  &#47;Poul"
