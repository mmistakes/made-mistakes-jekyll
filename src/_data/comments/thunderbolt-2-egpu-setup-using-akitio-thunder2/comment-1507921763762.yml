message: "Hi Fahim\n\nIt sounds like a power issue. Do you use a powered riser or a 120 watt power brick with the AKiTiO Thunder2? If you do not, the card might not get enough power if you are using a 6-pin connector since the PCIe port from the AKiTiO Thunder2 can only supply 25 watts + 75 watts from the 6-pin connector = 100 watts which is not enough according to [this](http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=02G-P4-1952-KR). If you are using a card with a 8-pin connector you should be fine. Also a low quality power supply can be the problem.\n\n/Poul"
