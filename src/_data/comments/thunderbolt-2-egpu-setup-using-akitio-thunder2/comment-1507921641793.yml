message: "Hi Carl\r\n\r\nHmmm, can you see anything in the event logs (Event Viewer)? If not we might need to enable some boot logging to troubleshot further as described in [this](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tr-dojo/monitor-windows-7-boot-logs-with-the-help-of-msconfig/) link. Try enabling boot logging, boot with the Thunderbolt dock enabled which will fail, then reboot without the dock and look in the log file. It could give us a clue as to what is going on.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
