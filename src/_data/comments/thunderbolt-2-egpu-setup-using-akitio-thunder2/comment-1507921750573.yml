message: "Poul\n\nThanks for posting this. I bought a GTX 1080 card with a EVGA Supernova 650W G2 PSU as well as the Akitio box, I ordered the riser which is on its way. I am curious if you could give a bit more detail on how you connect your PSU to the GPU? I was fiddling around with the cables which came with the PSU and pretty much the only way I could \"connect\" the two was using the VGA 8 pin into the GPU and using the 6+2 pin connector into the PSU. I suppose once the Riser gets here I should be able to find a way to connect the PSU to that as well, but I was wondering if the connection to the GPU is acceptable? Or if you could recommend a connector? Thanks again!!!"
