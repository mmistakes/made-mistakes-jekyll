message: "|- Hey there,  After reading your post and doing some more research, here is what I am planning to do.  But a MSI WS60 workstation laptop, which is equipped with TB2 with windows 8.1 pro. Will buy an AKiTiO Thunder 2 with an Gigabyte and Evga GTX 970. For PSU, I will go for a corsair branded 300 watt gpu.  So here is my question, will I be able to run it on ws60 without external monitor, because it has Quadro GPU integrated, which I guess won't allow nvidia Optimus to work. And is my list up to the potential to run GTA 5, AC Unity and other demanded games."
