message: "Thank you for your reply and for your instructions! I do not plan to use this solution for computer games. The main objective is to work with 4k footage. Editing and post-production in  DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere. I hope that in this case the loss of performance will not be so noticeable. But thanks anyway for the comparative test. Is PSU CORSAIR CX500M adapter suitable for this device? I can not find ENERMAX PRO82+ in my country. GTX 970 Ð¸ 980 wants 500 watts of electricity."
