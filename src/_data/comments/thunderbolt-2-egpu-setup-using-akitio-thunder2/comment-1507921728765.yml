message: "Hi Poul,\n\nThanks for your reply, I think it will be a case of experimentation once I get all my parts ... my only concern is that if I plug the CInema Display directly in to the eGPU, that will work fine for Windows 10, but if I need to use Mac OS I will need to plug the Cinema Display directly in to the MacBook ... not a huge deal I guess in the grand scheme but not streamlined. ;-)\n\nThanks again, will post my progress.\n\nKevin"
