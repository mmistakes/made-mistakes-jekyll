message: "|- I wanted to order everything from Amazon so I could get it by tomorrow ( very impatient ;) ).  Here are the two different things I ordered:  This is the pci riser I got:  https:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00QBYOLIQ&#47;ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  This one, like the one you used, has both a positive and negative cable as well as a capacitor.  I am expecting this to be the solution to the problem.  However, I ordered something else just to be sure.  https:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B0121QHR2E&#47;ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  I have seen a few people use solutions similar to this to power their card and Akitio, so I figured I might as well grab both for maximum chance at getting this stuff to work.  I would prefer not to use the barrel plug however, because then I would have to modify my Akitio to accommodate my large 970.  Thanks for your help, I will let you know how everything goes tomorrow night!  Considering making a YouTube video about the whole process, if I do I will be sure to mention this post and give you credit for helping me out."
