message: "I wanted to order everything from Amazon so I could get it by tomorrow ( very impatient ;) ). Here are the two different things I ordered:  This is the pci riser I got:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QBYOLIQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1]()\n\nThis one, like the one you used, has both a positive and negative cable as well as a capacitor. I am expecting this to be the solution to the problem.\n\nHowever, I ordered something else just to be sure.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0121QHR2E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1]()\n\nI have seen a few people use solutions similar to this to power their card and Akitio, so I figured I might as well grab both for maximum chance at getting this stuff to work. I would prefer not to use the barrel plug however, because then I would have to modify my Akitio to accommodate my large 970.\n\nThanks for your help, I will let you know how everything goes tomorrow night! Considering making a YouTube video about the whole process, if I do I will be sure to mention this post and give you credit for helping me out."
