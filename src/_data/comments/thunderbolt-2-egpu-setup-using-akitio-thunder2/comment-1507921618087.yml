message: "Try the following startup sequence\r\n\r\n1) Power on the AKiTiO box (I assume you are using the power supply from the AKiTiO in addition to the Coolermaster)\r\n2) Power on the MacBook holding down the alt key to get into the boot menu\r\n3) Power on the Coolermaster\r\n4) Boot into windows and check if you can see the GPU\r\n\r\nIn my old setup I needed to power on the thunderbolt case before turning on the laptop and then turn on the larger ATX power supply unit during og after the boot menu.\r\n\r\nSometimes a \"hot plug\" of the eGPU is needed the first time to get the device detected and install the driver, try searching forums for a guide."
