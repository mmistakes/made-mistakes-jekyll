message: ""Hi Michael\n\nCheck out <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.techpowerup.com&#47;reviews&#47;NVIDIA&#47;GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling&#47;3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<&#47;a> link for performance loss using this setup. It is not the same hardware, but it comes pretty close. They have tested 18 different games at different bandwidths. This setup is roughly equivalent to x4 PCIe 2.0 (the green bar in the benchmarks). The conclusion from the post: \n\n<blockquote>Real performance losses only become apparent in x8 1.1 and x4 2.0, where the performance drop becomes noticeable with around 15%.<&#47;blockquote>\n\nBut it really depends on which games and which resolutions you run as the post mentions:\n\n<blockquote>Contrary to intuition, the driving factor for PCI-Express bus width and speed for most games is the framerate, not resolution, and our benchmarks conclusively show that the performance difference between PCIe configurations shrinks at higher resolution. <&#47;blockquote>\n\nA good example of this is Ryse: Son of Rome, which you can see <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.techpowerup.com&#47;reviews&#47;NVIDIA&#47;GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling&#47;15.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a> is just 45% performance if running at low resolution but ~ 75% if running at high resolution\n\nIf you run this setup using only the laptop monitor then you will see an additional drop in performance.""
