message: "Hi AlGee\n\nYes, I have gotten the setup to work without an external monitor, also known as Optimus mode. You can read more in my post [here](/projects/external-graphics-card-egpu/) and [here](/projects/windows-10-egpu-setup-optimus/). To sum it up, you must use Windows (8.x or 10 with the correct driver should be fine) since OSX does not support Optimus and your laptop must support Optimus (physically you need an intel iGPU that is hooked up to the laptop screen directly). Which laptop do you have?\n\n/Poul"
