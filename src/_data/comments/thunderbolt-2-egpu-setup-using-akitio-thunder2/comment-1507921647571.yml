message: "|- Hi Carl  I apoligize if I was not more specific. I meant that <strong>you<&#47;strong> should post <a href="https:&#47;&#47;egpu.io&#47;diy-egpu-setup-1-30-nando4&#47;" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a> with the problem, I would just slow things down :) You should describe that you can successfully do a PCI compaction without the Thunderbolt dock, but not with the Thunderbolt dock attached. Post the error you described here (and maybe a screenshot of the error):  <blockquote>I tried the PCI compaction with the dock connected Macbook -> eGPU -> Dock and Macbook -> dock -> eGPU. The result was the same, it didn&rsquo;t work. As soon as I run de PCI compaction it stuck at saying: &ldquo;Found 5 external control methods, reparsing for new information&rdquo;. Then nothing happens for about 5 minutes, then the mac shuts down.<&#47;blockquote>  You should also post the PCI compaction settings (take a screenshot).  Hopefully Nando4, the creator of DIY eGPU setup, can help, he has always been very helpful with troubleshooting. You might also ask him about getting an upgrade to version 1.30 if it is free, that might also fix the problem.  If he can not help you then please let me know. A last resort if you cannot get the above to work is to install Windows 8+ in UEFI mode. UEFI setups are much more plug and play than BIOS setups. When I had Windows 7 BIOS I needed DIY eGPU setup, after I switched to Windows 8 UEFI I had no need for the program anymore. But only consider this if everything else fails and you talked to Nando4.  &#47;Poul"
