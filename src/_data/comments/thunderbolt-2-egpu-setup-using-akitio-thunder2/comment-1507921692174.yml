message: "So, this is pretty exciting. I have 2011 Macbook Pro 17\". Running Windows 10 in bios (legacy) boot mode. Akitio Thunder 2 PCI-e, Rosewill gold PSU, EVGA GTX 970 plugged directly into Akitio (no riser), and latest Nvidia Driver (364.51 win10 64bit). Macbook Pro has all bootcamp drivers installed and working (internal Radeon 6750M fully working). It just booted into Windows 10 with eGPU fully working. Ran several Steam VR tests and score either very top of \"Capable\" (yellow bar), or into low end of \"Ready\" (green bar). Only drawback, I have to boot using the timing method. Thunderbolt cable plugged in, but PSU powered off. Boot holding option, to boot selection screen. Hit enter on Windows, wait 3 seconds, and power on PSU. (Akitio is powered from PSU using barrel adapter). I thought only an EFI mode install of Win10 would work, but was shocked when this booted for me. Perhaps latest Nvidia drivers changed something?"
