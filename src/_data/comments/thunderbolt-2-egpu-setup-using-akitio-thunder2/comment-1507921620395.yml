message: "As far as I can see you need a riser as I wrote before since the card will use 120-150 watts of power. The PCIe port on the AKiTiO will supply 25 watts and the single 6pin connector 75 watt, a total of 100 watt which is not enough. That might be the problem. Normally the PCIe port can supply 75 watt, but not on the AKiTiO box"
