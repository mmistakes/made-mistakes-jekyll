message: "|- Hi. I wanna build the same setup as you. The question is, how do I know my macbook( Macbook pro 13 retina mid 2014 with intel Iris 5100) support intel gpu Optimus, so I can use internal display in windows 8.1?  Other question, where can I download UEFI version of Windows 8.1?  Thanks for this epic guide, much appreciated"
