message: "|- Hi Poul,  Just thought I would give an update, finally got all of my parts (the Akitio box took forever to ship to Australia). I literally threw it all together to test, it looks near identical to your picture above currently, plugged in to, booted, installed drivers, rebooted and we're done.  Side note - it displays flawlessly through the Cinema Display, even when the Cinema Display is plugged directly into the Macbook - once I get my Mini displayport to Displayport adapter I will compare benchmarks to see if there's a drastic difference between plugging directly into GPU or not, but for now, very happy - you sir have presented the simplest and most efficient means to getting one of these up and running, kudos.  Now to retrofit the Akitio guts into my MiniITX case. :)  Kevin"
