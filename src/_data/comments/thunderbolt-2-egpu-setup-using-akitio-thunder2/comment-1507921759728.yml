message: "Thanks for the info Poul,\n\nContrary to your comments, I decided to go with an EVGA brand to test. There was too much work getting that XFX to get the correct timing than it was worth the time. Not even the PCI riser did what was necessary to get this going. The EVGA card worked OOB. I'd stay away from GTX 750 and GTX 650 as the DSDT guide describes, they require increase memory allocation on the PCI Bus. However I haven't test the same theory with a GTX 950. Since I created a DSDT to fit the GTX 750, the 950 worked OOB after. By the way I using BIOS since it's a bootcamp installation, but it works the same way using your instructions.\n\nAlso worth noticing if it hasn't been mentioned before, must use a card that requires its own power source. Self-powered cards become extremely unstable. At least that was my experience. It worked fine under idle or low loads, but it became unresponsive as soon as set medium to heavy loads. In my case playing a 2016 game from low to medium settings the 750 became unstable.\n\nOther than the few scenarios described above, my setup works flawlessly.\n\nThanks, Poul."
