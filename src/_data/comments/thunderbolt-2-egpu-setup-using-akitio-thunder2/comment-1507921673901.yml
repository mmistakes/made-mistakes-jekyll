message: "Hi Toni\n\nWell with Windows you can drive the internal screen of the laptop with the external GPU, something that is not possible with OS X, therefore Windows is more fun :) It does work with OS X, I have not written a recent post about it, but check out [http://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/12/04/a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite/]() on getting an NVIDIA card working under OS X using an external monitor. Using an ATI card under OS X is also possible, check out this forum here: [https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/113-implementation-guides-apple/]()\n\nAnd more specifically the following post: [https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/6745-2014-15%E2%80%9D-mbp-iris-2x-r9_280x16gbps-tb2-netstor-na211tb-win81osx-goalque/]()\n\nThere are not many posts on using an ATI card under OS X, the above is the closest thing I know and that is not even using an AKiTiO Thunder2. I would still recommend an NVIDIA card to fit in the AKiTiO Thunder2, just remember that the PCIe port can only supply 25 watts of power.\n\n/Poul"
