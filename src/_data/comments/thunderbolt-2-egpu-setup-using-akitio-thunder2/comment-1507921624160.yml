message: "- What will be the loss of graphics card performance compared to the same card plugged into the motherboard?  \n- I want to use this solution with the MacBook Pro 15\" (late 2013), and an eGPU to connect 4K monitor (Benq3201pt). Will I get 4K at frequency of 60Hz? I plan to use GeForce GTX 970. As far as I know none of MacBook can output a resolution with such frequency using internal GPU"
