message: "|- Hi Michael  First I would connect the monitor directly to the GTX 970, that is the way I have it working. It will give you the best performance since the output signal does not need to use the Thunderbolt cable. I am not sure it will work if not attached directly to the card.  Secondly did you follow <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.journaldulapin.com&#47;2014&#47;12&#47;04&#47;a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite&#47;" rel="nofollow">this <&#47;a>guide for getting Thunderbolt enabled? Without this step it will not show up in Yosemite. Notice that you need to reapply the KEXT file fix every time you update OS X. Try to retrace your steps and confirm everything is working as described in the guide. Make also sure the NVIDIA driver is used and not the native OS X driver.  And lastly you don't need to use the AKiTiO power supply that I can see in the picture you have taken of your setup since you have a powered PCIe riser. Just unplug it :)  &#47;Poul"
