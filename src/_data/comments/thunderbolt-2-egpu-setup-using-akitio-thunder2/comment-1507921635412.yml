message: ""Hi Poul,\n\nI got it working! Tried the tests you mentioned and was about to comment my results here when I thought I'd try one last time. \n\nTurns out one of my thunderbolt connections appears to not work, which I'm not happy about as I only got my mac in January. However when the monitor is plugged in via the egpu the mac monitor remains on, which I thought was strange. I can bear with that in the meantime. Thanks for all your suggestions, I'm just glad it's all working now! \n\nCheers, Owen""
