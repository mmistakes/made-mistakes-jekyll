message: "Hmm, I am not sure what is wrong, everything looks fine to me. One last thing you can try is to use the Kext Wizard utility, I use this myself:\n\n[http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/253395-kext-wizard-easy-to-use-kext-installer-and-more/](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/253395-kext-wizard-easy-to-use-kext-installer-and-more/)\n\nAnd try to rebuild the cache from there. If it still does not work then I would recommend that you try to post a description of the problem at the TechInferno eGPU forum [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/).\n\n/Poul"
