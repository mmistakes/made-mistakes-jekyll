message: ""Hmm, I am not sure what is wrong, everything looks fine to me. One last thing you can try is to use the Kext Wizard utility, I use this myself:\n\n<a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.insanelymac.com&#47;forum&#47;topic&#47;253395-kext-wizard-easy-to-use-kext-installer-and-more&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#47;&#47;www.insanelymac.com&#47;forum&#47;topic&#47;253395-kext-wizard-easy-to-use-kext-installer-and-more&#47;<&#47;a>\n\nAnd try to rebuild the cache from there. If it still does not work then I would recommend that you try to post a description of the problem at the TechInferno eGPU forum <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;83-diy-e-gpu-projects&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>. \n\n&#47;Poul""
