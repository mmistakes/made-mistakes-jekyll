message: "|- Hey Paul, I was searching on the internet for information about making an eGPU and i found your article the most accurate. The only thing that is still confusing me is where to buy the PCI-e to thunderbolt adaptor. I read on the AKiTiO that the card is not included and i serched it alover the internet but i get nothing. May i ask u where did u get one and (if u know more card of that type) which is the cheaper?  Thanks, Luca."
