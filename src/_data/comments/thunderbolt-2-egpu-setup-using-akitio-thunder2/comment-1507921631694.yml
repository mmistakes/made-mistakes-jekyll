message: "Hi Jaydev\n\nIt seems it should be possible to use Optimus with a setup similar to yours, but I have no experience with laptops with discrete GPUs. However, check this info out:\n\nYou can use software like [DIY eGPU Setup 1.30](https://egpu.io/diy-egpu-setup-1-30-nando4/) to disable the dGPU and therefore activate Optimus with the eGPU. According to the site that is one of the uses of the software:\n\n> want to disable a dGPU in a hybrid graphics system to activate NVidia Optimus and if using a x1 link, engage x1 pci-e compression\n\n I would recommend trying to get it to work without the the above software first and then use it as a last resort if all else fails.\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/3108-egpu-candidate-system-list/) post by Nando the WS60 is on the recommended candidate list without any comments about issues using the dGPU together with an eGPU and Optimus. Instead of disabling the dGPU you might even try to enable all 3 GPUs as explained here. That said, as far as I know you need to get both the eGPU and dGPU running under the same driver as explained [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/1656-diy-egpu-troubleshooting-faq/#common_faq10) or [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/2750-guide-dsdt-override-simultaneous-igpu-dgpu-egpu/).\n\nI will always recommend en EVGA cards since I know these work better with eGPU setups (less steps involved). But you should be fine with other brands\n\nAnd 300 watts of power should be plenty for an eGPU setups like yours, just make sure it has at least two 6-pin PEG connectors for the GPU."
