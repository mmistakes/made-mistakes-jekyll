message: ""Hey Poul. I got all my stuff now, installed the drivers (Nvidia recognises it when I plug it in after the computer is turned off!) But when I try to boot the computer up with the GPU plugged in, it just stays at the windows 10 'rotating dots' loading screen. Here's my info:\n\nretina MacBook Pro 2015, 3,1gHz i7, 512GB&#47;16GBRAM, Windows 10 64bit on a 130gb partition (internal).\n\nBoot steps: Unplug everything, turn off Power Supply for the Graphics card and for the Akitio box.\n\nPlug Thunderbolt cable into computer while laptop is turned OFF.\n\nTurn on PSU for graphics card and Akitio box. (Using a surge protector strip, turn them on at the exact same time).\n\nWait ~15 seconds, turn MacBook Pro on holding Option key. (Type in firmware password). Select Windows partition. \n\nScreen goes black. Comes back on (still black colour). Loading dots come up. Spin around. Will stay like this for 10 minutes (longest I left it, since I'm assuming that's a fuckup)\n\nReally don't know what to do anymore. Checked the link you sent about powering on on the 2015 MacBook Pro and following that to a tee. Drivers ARE already installed in the GeForce Experience app on Windows successfully.""
