message: "Hi Paul,\r\nI recently trying to build my egpu according to your post. But I ran into a serious problem that after I installed windows via uefi, I can't log into windows while the thunderbolt cable plugged in.\r\nIt always shows a blank screen, and then reboot, showing apple logo and a loading bar, then reboot again. At this stage, windows logo and loading circle showed, but after this, nothing happens. Nothing on screen, pure black. One time I got a error message of hal_initialization_failed. \r\nThen everything repeat and repeat. I can only log into windows without plugging the cable.\r\nMaybe you've experienced this during your setup? Or may you please give some posssivle clue on this? I searched through the google and now head got totally messed up. \r\nThanks."
