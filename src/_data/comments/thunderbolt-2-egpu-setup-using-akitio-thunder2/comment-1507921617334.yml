message: "Hi!\n\nI've just started to setup my eGPU with:\n\nAkitio Thunder 2  \nGTX 960 mini Gigabyte  \nCoolermaster 650w (Paperclip)\n\nSo my problem is I can't install the Nvidia drivers. I've put the GPU into the PCI slot in the akitio box. Then I've connected the akitio Power supply. And then I've connected the 6-pin Cable into the GTX 960 from the Cooler Master.\n\nI'm booting up my mac (Mid 2014 13') and pressing alt. When the bootcamp selection start I turn on the coolermaster and the akitio PSU. After that I press boot windows (windows 8.1 preview). When I'm searching for the egpu i cannot find it in the device manager either in OSX.\n\nWhen I trying to install the Nvidia drivers (the newest one) it says 'Nvidia Installer cannot continue' 'The graphic driver could not find compatible Graphics hardware'.\n\nThe fans on the GPU started the first time I booted the computer (That was in OSX) and after that thay never started again.\n\nThe akitio box blue and green light is up. I've connected the akitio through thunderbolt (ofcourse).\n\nI've put a HDMI Cable from the GTX 960 to my external Acer minitor and made it as the main screen in windows 8.\n\nCould you guys help me out? Why dosent my computer detect the GPU? I've tried the troubleshooting steps in the forum but it doesnt work."
