message: "Hi Andrew\n\nYes, you would need a Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter, but they are quite pricy. I would recommend a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU solution since you get even more plug and play, but yes it is pricy and not perfect. I am not sure Optimus is supported in linux so you will need an external monitor to get great performance. And I am not sure Thunderbolt 3 support is included in the kernel, check out [this](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/dell-xps-13-dev-thunderbolt/) post. But once the support is in the kernel it should work, but I would search the internet a bit more to confirm it.\n\n/Poul"
