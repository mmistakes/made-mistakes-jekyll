message: "Hi Poul, \n\nIt's my friend who actually owns the 970 so will try some of the tests you mentioned when he's next available.\n\nTo clarify, should the blue light be lit all the time on the akitio box. With no riser plugged in, just the green light is lit. Is the blue light an activity LED? Mine briefly flashes when power is switched on, then turns off both with an empty riser and no riser. \n\nI will let you know results off other tests as soon as I can can. Thanks again. \n\nOwen"
