message: "Hi Ish\r\n\r\nAs far as I know it is not possible to use Optimus other than in Windows, therefore you cannot use the internal monitor in Ubuntu. There are tricks, like using a video grabber and routing the signal back in that way, but nothing easy and simple as using Optimus. You should ask around [TechInferno](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) to confirm my statement and maybe find a different solution.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
