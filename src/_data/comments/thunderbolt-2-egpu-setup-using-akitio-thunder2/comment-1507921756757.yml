message: "|- Hi Ish  As far as I know it is not possible to use Optimus other than in Windows, therefore you cannot use the internal monitor in Ubuntu. There are tricks, like using a video grabber and routing the signal back in that way, but nothing easy and simple as using Optimus. You should ask around <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;83-diy-e-gpu-projects&#47;" rel="nofollow">TechInferno<&#47;a> to confirm my statement and maybe find a different solution.  &#47;Poul"
