message: "Quick question: If I am worried about getting a crappy powered riser, can I just use a 12V 120W power supply on the Akitio unit? Their website says that it supports power supplies up to 120W. I would use the one here:  \n[http://www.amazon.com/short-circuit-com-AC-DC-Switching-Power-Adapter/dp/B00638KS3W]()  \nIf I did my math right (I'm horrible at electrical) that will leave 85W available to the GPU? This is the link on their website with the power information:  \n[https://www.akitio.com/faq/270-thunder2-pcie-box-what-s-the-maximum-power-output-through-the-pcie-slot]()  \nSo if I used that power supply, shouldn't the unit then supply a max 85W through the PCI-E slot without the need for a powered riser? Thanks for the help! And I apologize if you have already answered this before."
