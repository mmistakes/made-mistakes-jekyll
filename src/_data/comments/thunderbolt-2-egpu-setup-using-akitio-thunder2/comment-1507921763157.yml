message: "Hi Poul\n\nThanks for the post. I bought EVGA GTX 950 and have been using your setup for several months. It is working fine but it gets unstable under heavy load (the app/game get crashed) so I have to do underclock using EVGA precision. Do you have any idea why this happens?\n\nThanks!  \nFahim"
