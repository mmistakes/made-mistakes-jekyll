message: "Hi Carl\r\n\r\nCan you do a PCI compaction successfully without the Thunderbolt dock? Do you get the same error? If you only get the error when using the Thunderbolt dock then I would post your problem on the techinferno forums since they have better knowledge of troubleshooting this than I have: https://egpu.io/diy-egpu-setup-1-30-nando4/\r\n\r\nThe DSDT override (if needed) is explained [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/5874-guide-dsdt-override-to-fix-error-12/#comment-91134) with a step by step guide. However I strongly recommend that you troubleshoot 1) first."
