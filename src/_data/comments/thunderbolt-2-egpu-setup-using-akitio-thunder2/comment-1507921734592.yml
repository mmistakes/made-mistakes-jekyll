message: "Hey Poul. \n\nI pretty much immediately ditched 10 (it's not that big a deal for me. i was more comfortable with 8 anyway) and got it working. I can even use my wireless controller for xbox one!  \n\nBooting is still a little finicky. Sometimes the mac refuses to boot, and I have to disconnect/reconnect the magsafe charger while holding down the power button. Occasionally still getting boot hangs too, any ideas how to reduce that? Currently, I turn off my PC power supply, unplug/plug the Thunderbolt cable, turn PC power supply on (Using the Akitio box powered as well, i don't turn that off), wait ~10 seconds and then boot (boots straight into windows). It's mostly successful but still sometimes fails and I don't know why- think I'm doing everything the same. Any tips?\n\nPS: thanks for leaving this in a comment on Amazon. You finally encouraged/gave me the bravery to do this (i had wanted to for years)."
