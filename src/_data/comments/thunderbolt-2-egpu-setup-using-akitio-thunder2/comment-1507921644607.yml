message: "Hmm ok. No need to send me the log files if they are the same. I would still like some log files from the crash, it could give a pointer to what is going on. Since the only difference is added hardware and therefore memory allocation in PCI space, then DIY eGPU setup might be the issue\n \n<ol>\n\t<li>Do you use PCI compaction to get enough memory available to the GPU? If yes, then you might need to do a PCI compaction with both the eGPU and Thunderbolt dock connected. When I connected other devices after doing the first compaction I would get strange behaviour<&#47;li>\n\t<li>If it turns out it is a PCI compaction issue and you are enable to free enough space because of the Thunderbolt dock, then you might need to to a DSDT override into 36 bit space<&#47;li>\n\t<li>As a last resort you might also want to upgrade to DIY eGPU 1.30 which is the version I used to use<&#47;li>\n<&#47;ol>\n\nIf we are lucky the PCI compaction might reveal what is wrong. Please let me know about 1) and 2) first\n\n&#47;Poul"
