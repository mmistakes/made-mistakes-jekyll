message: "Hi Poul \nhotplug didn't work me. And I saw this morning that I am still using DiY egpu Setup 1.20. Will that be a problem? I enabled boot logging and in both files there are many drivers not loaded. However they are the same ones which loaded and which didn't. If you like I can send you both of the files.\n\nCarl"
