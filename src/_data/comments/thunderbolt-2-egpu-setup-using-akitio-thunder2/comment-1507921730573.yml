message: "Hello, is the powered PCie riser mandatory? I'm thinking about getting one of the smaller cards https:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;EVGA-GeForce-Clocked-Graphic-04G-P4-3962-KR&#47;dp&#47;B00VX1MJQ8&#47;ref=cm_cd_al_qh_dp_i I want it to be able to fit inside the Akitio thunderbox so I might get the mini gtx 960 for my mid-2014 Retina Macbook Pro 15". I assume only a PSU, akitio box, and the gpu are needed, am I correct? Also in regards to drivers for the 960 working on OSX, would I have to go anywhere special to obtain them? Thanks!"
