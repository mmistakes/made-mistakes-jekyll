message: "Hello, is the powered PCie riser mandatory? I'm thinking about getting one of the smaller cards [https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Clocked-Graphic-04G-P4-3962-KR/dp/B00VX1MJQ8/ref=cm_cd_al_qh_dp_i]() I want it to be able to fit inside the Akitio thunderbox so I might get the mini gtx 960 for my mid-2014 Retina Macbook Pro 15\". I assume only a PSU, akitio box, and the gpu are needed, am I correct? Also in regards to drivers for the 960 working on OSX, would I have to go anywhere special to obtain them?  \nThanks!"
