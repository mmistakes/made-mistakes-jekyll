message: "Hi Mouah\r\n\r\nDid you use the paperclip trick to turn on the power supply to the graphic card and can you confirm that it delivers power? Also try to get the setup working using an external monitor connected to the graphic card, this is the easiest setup to troubleshoot. Finally, some people have issues with the 2015 Macbook Pro Retina 2015 as you can read [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/7757-2015-13-mbp-gtx97016gbps-tb2-akitio-thunder2-win81-franknickzhang/).
