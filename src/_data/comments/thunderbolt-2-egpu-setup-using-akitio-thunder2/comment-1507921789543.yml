message: "Hi John\r\n\r\nDid you try the first step in the troubleshooting section? I did get a blank screen once, I solved this by using the \"Windows key\" + P and using the arrows switching monitor setups. Also you could try to attach an external monitor if you did not try this already.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
