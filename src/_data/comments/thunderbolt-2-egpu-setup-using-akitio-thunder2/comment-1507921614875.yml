message: "'Hi Jonathan<br &#47;><br &#47;>"Am i going to need a riser?"<br &#47;>There are two aspects in this. First does the card physically fit in the AKiTiO Thunder case? The Asus GTX 960 might be short enough to fit. But as far as i can see the Asus GTX 960 draws up to 150 watts. With only a single 6pin GPU connector rated up to 75 watts, the PCIe port should deliver 75 watt power for a total of 150 watt. The PCIe port on the AKiTiO is limited to just 25 watt, so without a powered PCIe riser you would only get a total of 100 watt which is not enough according to the power consumptions i have read online for the GTX 960. The GTX 970 have two 6 pin connecters for a total of 150 watt + the 25 watt from the PCIe port so in my case i do actually not need the riser, but my card is too big to physically fit. I would recommend that you buy the PCIe riser as it is quite inexpensive just to be sure<br &#47;><br &#47;>"What kind of PSU do you recommend?"<br &#47;>Since your card will only draw up to 150 watt (maybe more if you plan to overclock) i would recommend to get a 250-300 watt power supply that is gold rated and silent. Notice that some combinations og PSUs and graphics cards produce coil whine so don''t get the cheapest PSU. And since you will only use 1 6pin connector, the ATX connecter and maybe a single molex for the PCIe riser, get a modular PSU so you can avoid unnessesary cables.<br &#47;><br &#47;>"...  will this work with windows 7 through bootcamp?"<br &#47;>There are a few different from my setup and yours. I have bought an EVGA branded graphics cards since this is internally different powered than from must other brands. I will not go into details, but since you have an ASUS they might require you either power on the PSU just before the windows boot logo. You might need a modified PCIe riser for this. My recommendation would be to do this<br &#47;><br &#47;>1) Install Windows 7 64 bit in UEFI mode via bootcamp (see option 2 in this post for seeing if you have UEFI og BIOS (legacy): http:&#47;&#47;www.eightforums.com&#47;tutorials&#47;29504-bios-mode-see-if-windows-boot-uefi-legacy-mode.html)<br &#47;>2) Connect a monitor to the GPU and try getting it to work using an external monitor first. This is usually the the easy part, especially if you have windows installed as UEFI<br &#47;>3) Work then in getting Optimus (the internal screen) to work. It might require you to power on the PSU at either the boot screen og when you see the Windows logo.<br &#47;><br &#47;>There are plenty posts on this on the net and a few on my blog. So to sum it up, it should work, but it might not be as plug and play as my setup since you are not using an EVGA card. However i have previously had a similar setup so i know it works with Windows 7. If you run into some problems, let me know and i will do my best to help!<br &#47;><br &#47;>&#47;Poul'"
