message: "|- Not much, I would say that with at least 100 watts of power you should be safe. 70 watts from the GTX 750 ti (max power consumption I could find) + 10 watts to the AKiTiO box = 80 watts. Add another 20% to sure (never run a power supply on full load all the time) = 80*1,2 ~ 100 watt. So I would buy a replacement power brick for maybe 120+ watt. You only need to power the PCIe riser, there is no need to power the AKiTiO  &#47;Poul"
