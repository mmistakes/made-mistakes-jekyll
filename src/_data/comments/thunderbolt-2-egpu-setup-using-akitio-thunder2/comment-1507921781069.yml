message: "|- Hi Patrick  I have not tried it, but the numbers do stack up. The cards draws around 120 watts as far as I can see and 75 watts can safely be supplied through the AKiTiO Thunder 2, the rest needs to be through the 75 watt 6-pin connector. So you cannot safely just use the molex to barrel adapter without also connecting a 6-pin connector to the card itself as 120 watts is too much for the AKiTiO through the PCIe port alone.  &#47;Poul"
