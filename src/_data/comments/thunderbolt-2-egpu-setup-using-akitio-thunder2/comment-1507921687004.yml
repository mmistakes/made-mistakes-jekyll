message: "Hi Jiaqi\n\nIf you underclock your graphics card, can you then run the benchmarks without crashing? If yes, then it might be a power stability issue, either the power supply is at fault or the powered riser might be of low quality. TechInferno does not recommend using powered risers any more, but I have not had any problems with them. But too often I see people buying inferior quality risers.\n\n/Poul"
