message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI found the reason why the card was unstable... I remember reading in various threads that \"always check/switch the PSU\" first! :) Didn't think that was the problem as it was brand new one and rated at 450W. The Sharkoon cant cope with the power/voltage required by the GTX980. (Currently using a Fractal Design 800W Platinum ATX PSU)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Do not use/buy the Sharkoon Silentstorm 450W PSU for eGPU setups. It cannot run at full power e.g. the EVGA GTX 980 SC.\r\n\r\nNow to return the Sharkoon PSU...  Any recommendations for a quality SFX PSU?\r\n\r\nJ"
