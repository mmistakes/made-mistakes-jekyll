message: ""Thank you so much Paul!\nI m going to follow your blog and the forum threads you linked,probably in 2016 more people will try this configuration with Win 10(it s already installed on my bootcamp partition..i had some troubles with the dear old Win 7 so i decided to upgrade my system). For sure that s what i meant about a plug n play config..it s not definitely a consolle but i m sure if it will work i ll love it :)\nThe main reason why i want to set up this gaming system is the Oculous Rift Visor that will be released during the next year. It should be awesome having a Macbook setted with an external video card that let you play games with a vr visor ! \nBtw thanks again for your reply,keep going !""
