message: "Hi William\n\nI am not sure if you can get go above the 75 watt limit of the PCIe standard, but plenty if people have upgraded to a 120 watt power supply to get (at least) the full 75 watts from the PCIe port. You might not even need a riser, but I like to make sure the card can draw the 75 watts of power. So yes, that should eliminate the need for a riser.\n\n/Poul"
