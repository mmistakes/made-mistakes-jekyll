message: "|- Hi Michael  To answer your second question:  <blockquote>I want to use this solution with the MacBook Pro 15&Prime; (late 2013), and an eGPU to connect 4K monitor (Benq3201pt). Will I get 4K at frequency of 60Hz? I plan to use GeForce GTX 970. As far as I know none of MacBook can output a resolution with such frequency using internal GPU<&#47;blockquote>  It should be able to do 4K at 60Hz just fine depending on the game, again according to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.techpowerup.com&#47;reviews&#47;NVIDIA&#47;GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling&#47;3.html" rel="nofollow">this<&#47;a> post. It is the GTX 980, but it is close to your GTX 970 which I also own. If you cannot hit 60 frames per second, it is probably a limitation of the GPU and settings more than the bandwidth."
