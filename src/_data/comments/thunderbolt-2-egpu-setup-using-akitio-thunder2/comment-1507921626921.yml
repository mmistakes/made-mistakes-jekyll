message: "Hi Michael\n\nTo answer your second question: \n> I want to use this solution with the MacBook Pro 15\" (late 2013), and an eGPU to connect 4K monitor (Benq3201pt). Will I get 4K at frequency of 60Hz? I plan to use GeForce GTX 970. As far as I know none of MacBook can output a resolution with such frequency using internal GPU\n\nIt should be able to do 4K at 60Hz just fine depending on the game, again according to [this](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling/3.html) post. It is the GTX 980, but it is close to your GTX 970 which I also own. If you cannot hit 60 frames per second, it is probably a limitation of the GPU and settings more than the bandwidth."
