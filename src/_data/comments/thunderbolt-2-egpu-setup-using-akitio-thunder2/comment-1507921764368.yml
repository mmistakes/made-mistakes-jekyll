message: "Hi Lewis\n\nIf you are using one with only a 6-pin connecter without a riser or a 120 watt power brick replacement for the AKiTiO Thunder 2 you might not get enough power since the [stated](http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=06G-P4-6163-KR) power draw needed is higher than the supplied of 25 + 75 = 100 watt. Are you using a BIOS setup or UEFI? BIOS can be more tricky to setup which might be the problem.\n\n/Poul"
