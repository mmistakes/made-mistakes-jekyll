message: "Hi Lorenzo\n\nThank you! Since you already have NVIDIA drivers installed I assume you have a Macbook Pro with a NVIDIA graphics card inside. This should be possible as described [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/5226-2013-15-mbp-gt750m-gtx780ti16gbps-tb2-sonnet-iii-d-win81-squinks/).\n\n1. I have not tried it with Windows 10 yet, but according to [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/8244-mbpr-egpu-windows-10/) post some people have gotten it to work, but not everyone, read more [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/8918-egpu-window-10-optimus-mode-problem/&page=1). I would not recommend upgrading right now for you because you might need to reinstall everything to get it working.\n2. If you already have a working installation with NVIDIA drivers I would try that first. I also recommend using something like [WinClone](http://twocanoes.com/products/mac/winclone) to backup the Bootcamp partition just in case something goes wrong, I use this program myself\n3. It should be plug and play because of the EVGA card and a compatible Thunderbolt laptop. By plugin and play I mean that you still need to turn off the laptop, then connect the EGPA setup, then boot into Windows Bootcamp. Unplugging the setup requires to turn off the laptop and unplug the cable. But that is the most plug and play you can get for now until Thunderbolt 3 comes out.\n\n/Poul"
