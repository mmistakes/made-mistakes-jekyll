message: "Hi, looking to do this with my Dell XPS 13 9530 i7. Planning to purchase the new AKiTiO Thunder3 box and a half length GTX 960. Is there a way to make the setup look \"cleaner\"? I don't want the wife to think I'm building a bomb in the living room LOL.\n\nIs there a way to mount the GPU on the AKiTiO slot without accepting power from the AKiTiO PSU simply to have the card mounted in the box? I plan on cutting a hole in the aluminum case to route the power cables through to the main PSU. Ideally, I want to have the case closed over the card."
