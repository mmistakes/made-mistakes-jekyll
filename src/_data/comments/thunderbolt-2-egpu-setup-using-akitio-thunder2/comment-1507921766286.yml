message: "Hi Poul, \n\nI use GTX 950 with 6 pin connector, AeroCool 550W PSU and a powered riser bought in amazon.com here: https:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00GYBI3NU&#47;ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 \n\nIt seems the riser is not as good as the riser you suggested from moddiy.com. My riser doesn't have a capacitor and only single wire molex, while your riser has a capacitor and multiple wire molex. Do you think my riser could be the problem?\n\nFahim"
