message: "Hi Alex\r\n\r\nThe GTX 980 ti is a Maxwell card that should work under Yosemite according to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/3azfyz/gtx_980_ti_works_in_10103_with_nvidia_web_drivers/) post. I use these web drivers myself in Yosemite, but for the GTX 970 card which is also a Maxwell card. Follow [this](http://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/12/04/a-nvidia-maxwell-card-with-thunderbolt-on-a-mac-running-yosemite/) guide to install the NVIDIA web drivers that make this solution possible. Once the drivers are installed, they are easily updated using the interface.\r\n\r\n/Poul"
