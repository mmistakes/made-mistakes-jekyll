message: "Hi Carl\n\nI also use a Thunderbolt dock that is connected like this \n\nMacBook --> eGPU --> Dock\n\nThere are a few options to troubleshoot here\n<ol>\n\t<li>Try booting the setup as described above but without anything connected to the Belkin Thunderbolt hub, just the Thunderbolt cable. Sometimes a USB device or something can cause a crash (it did in my previous eGPU setup!)<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Does the Belkin dock work when you don't use the eGPU? MacBook --> Dock?<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Do you use an external monitor? If yes, how is the monitor connected, directly to the graphic card or through the HDMI port of the Belkin dock?<&#47;li>\n\t<li>You are using Windows 7, is it installed as UEFI or BIOS? Check <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;blogs.technet.com&#47;b&#47;home_is_where_i_lay_my_head&#47;archive&#47;2012&#47;10&#47;02&#47;how-to-check-in-windows-if-you-are-using-uefi.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<&#47;a> guide to find it. It might be that the Belkin is taking up some memory space that the eGPU setup needs.<&#47;li>\n<&#47;ol>\n\n&#47;Poul"
