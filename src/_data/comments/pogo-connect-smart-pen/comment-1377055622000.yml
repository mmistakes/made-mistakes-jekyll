message: "[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqUOU894nyE) might help explain the difference between pressure sensitive
  pen's (like the Pogo Connect Smart Pen) and normal ones (like an AluPen).\r\n\r\nThe
  other pressure sensitive styli shown in the video are not supported by Paper, but
  it does a good job of showing the basics of how line width and color can be manipulated
  by applying pressure with the pen."
