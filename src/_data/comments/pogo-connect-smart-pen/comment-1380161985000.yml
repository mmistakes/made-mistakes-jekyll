message: "My third stylus just broke. They responded by sending me a fourth and
  saying that they have addresses the issue.  I love their customer service. I hope
  the fourth pen won't break like they say. I have looked at the jot touch 4 for its
  different approach and finer control but I'm not a fan of the rechargeable battery.
  I like the user replaceable option. I've eyestalks the Wacom but if the new Pogo
  holds up I'll stick with it."
