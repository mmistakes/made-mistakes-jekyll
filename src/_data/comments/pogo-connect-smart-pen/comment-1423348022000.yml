message: "Thanks Alex.\r\n\r\nNot sure on the Pogo Connect 2. I only own the original
  and gave up drawing with it when I upgraded to an Air 2. It's possible there's been
  an update to the Pogo's SDK that Paper needs and that could explain why other apps
  support it fine.\r\n\r\nProbably a question to ask TenOne and FiftyThree directly
  since I have little insight on it."
