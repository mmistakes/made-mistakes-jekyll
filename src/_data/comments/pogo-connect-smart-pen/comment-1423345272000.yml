message: "\r\n\r\nHey Michael! Was reading your block and your tricks and I'm really thankful
  for the effort you're taking by creating all the tutorials!! Hope you'll really write
  a book about paper, I'd be the first to buy it!!\r\n\r\nI have a question about the
  Pogo. There's a bug i couldn't get rid of. I have an iPad Air and a Pogo Connect
  2... In the Pogo App, the pressure sensitivity works great and also in Procreate
  but in Paper everything works the other way round... The pencil for example draws
  dark when i use almost no pressure and when i press harder the lines get lighter...
  You also recognized those problems or do you have any solution for this?\r\n\r\n"
