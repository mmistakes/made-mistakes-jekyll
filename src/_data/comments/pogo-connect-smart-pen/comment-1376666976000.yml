message: "If it's detail you're after I suggest one of the pens by Adonit that have
  the plastic disc on the tip. They're built for precision.\r\n\r\nIf you want the
  ability to control line weight and darkness by varying the amount of pressure applied
  the Pogo Connect is the only way to go.\r\n\r\nI came across this new pen from Adonit
  called the [Jot Touch 4](http://adonit.net/jot/touch/)
  that looks like the holy grail of styli, but it's not supported by Paper (and probably
  never will be). But if you use apps like Procreate and Sketchbook Pro on your iPad
  it might be the way to go."
