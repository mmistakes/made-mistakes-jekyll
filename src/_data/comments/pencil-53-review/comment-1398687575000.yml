message: "For more precision one of the Adonit styli with the plastic tips is probably
  better for writing. But you're going to have the same issue with line thickness
  with the pens and marker since it won't effect them.\r\n\r\nA Pogo Connect will let
  you control the thickness by the amount of pressure you apply. Lettering isn't really
  my thing so your mileage may vary, but I find it incredibly hard to use a Pogo when
  writing. Not sure what their return policy is but it's something I would try first
  before buying to see if it suits your needs. It's an expensive stylus to sink money
  into, doesn't work with the newer iPads, and has had some serious hardware issues
  (see [my post about it](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/)).\r\n\r\nThat said I love it
  for drawing."
