message: "I love my Pencil, but I found that when I put a screen protector on the
  iPad, there was a decrease in responsiveness. I removed the screen protector. However,
  I really do feel more comfortable when there is a protector in place and wondered
  if you use one, and if so, which one, and do you notice a decrease in responsiveness?"
