message: "Hey Michael, I've used the mesh tips and I also loved them until they
  began picking up more environmental dust or oil from minor traces on the glass of
  the iPad. I'm not one for messy screens at all, I'm borderline obsessive (understatement
  probably).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I loved it for about 3-4 months and then it just stopped working
  well. I even took suggestions for cleaning the tip. It was only a temporary fix.
  As a smooth glide the [Lynktec TruGlide Pro](http://www.lynktec.com/TruGlide-Pro-Microfiber-Stylus-p/lttg-0005.htm) was a favorite. But as I said,
  sadly the amazing contact faded with time. I didn't feel like investing in another
  once I picked up the Pencil by 53. The smooth surface of the Pencil was enough glide
  for me, but I have a much lighter hand.\r\n\r\nOH and regarding the Pencil and its blending
  features, I really thought it was great until the bugs that came with it attacked
  me. After an hour of work got completely wiped with a crash, I put the iPad down
  for a couple of months. It really enraged me because I had some minor crashes prior
  with the Bluetooth active. But that was a killer, lost too much. I've since started
  sketching again and hope to blog some new Paper work soon but I'll be posting mostly
  non-blend work. I'd rather avoid the potential for disaster. I really hate manually
  duplicating or backing up often. I look forward to newer and better things! Thanks
  for the great blog as always.. Mina"
