message: "I didn't like the feel of Pencil at first and was more used to completely
  round styli. Eventually I got over it and now I can't tell the difference. It's
  just a tool I pick up and use like any other.\r\n\r\nI hardly ever use the eraser
  and have yet to wear one out yet. The tips on the other hand... I go through fast
  and often. Through my informal tests I average about 3 hours of drawing before a
  tip rips and starts to streak on the screen. When applying a lot of pressure I've
  gotten tips to rip in under an hour, and when barely touching the screen up to 9
  hours. Even with the rubber ripping Pencil is usable for much longer, it just starts
  leaving black residue on the screen (easy to wipe off). And you can always use the
  other side of the tip until it rips there too.\r\n\r\nI think it really depends on
  your style of drawing and if you use the edge of Pencil more than the tip. If more
  people were pissed over tips wearing out too quickly there would be more noise about
  it in the community. There those who have told me they've had Pencil for up to a
  year and never replaced a tip. So there's that...\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Pencil is my main
  stylus. I went full time with it after I got a new iPad Air 2 and Paper added Surface
  Pressure. Previously I only used a Pencil to turn on the Blend feature and did the
  bulk of my drawing with a Pogo Connect. But after getting fed up with all the Pogo's
  hardware and software problems I ditched it.\r\n\r\nThe only time I don't use Pencil
  is when doing rough sketches or if I'm going to do a lot of pencil/line-work. To
  save my Pencil tips I use a cheap dumb stylus for my drawings until I'm ready for
  the control Surface Pressure enables."
