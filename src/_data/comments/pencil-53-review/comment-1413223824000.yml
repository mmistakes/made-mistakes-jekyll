message: "Glad you're enjoying Pencil.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've heard there will be
  an update to Paper soon to enable \"Surface Pressure\" on the pencil tool. Hopefully
  it's not too much longer until that update because I've been waiting to try out
  the \"shading\" effect 53 teased in [this video](http://vimeo.com/98146708) months ago."
