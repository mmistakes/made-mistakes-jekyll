message: "It's a nice enough stylus alright, but for $60 you might as well buy
  a Pogo Connect and use it with many other apps. Who wants a stylus that works with
  only a single app, with severe limitations, that prides itself on not having a proper
  backup option?\r\n\r\nNice try, FiftyThree... but get with the picture!"
