message: "Personally I like the extra weight and brushed metal look of the graphite
  one. And since I have no use for the magnetic clip-on feature of the walnut one
  I choose graphite, especially since it's $10 cheaper.\r\n\r\nThey both function exactly
  the same so it really comes down to which one you like the look of better and if
  clipping it onto a Smart Cover matters to you or not."
