message: "Yes still working perfectly, the build quality is excellent. I've pretty
  much stopped using the Pogo Connect because it's so unreliable and went back to
  Pencil with the 2.0.0 update. With iOS 8 came Surface Pressure in Paper and it brings
  line weight enhancements that put it on par with a Pogo Connect.\r\n\r\nIf I have
  one negative thing to say about Pencil it is the tips â€” they wear out much too fast.
  I've been doing some testing to determine how long a tip lasts under typical use
  and plan to post a follow up article soon.\r\n\r\nI also have an article in the works
  [describing Surface Pressure](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-paper/pencil/#surface-pressure-whats-that)
  in detail, but am waiting for an update to
  Paper that fully enables it for all the tools."
