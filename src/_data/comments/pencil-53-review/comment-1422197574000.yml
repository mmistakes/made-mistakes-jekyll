message: "I think that depends on the formulas and your expectations. If they're
  small and you can write really big it shouldn't be a problem, but if they're long
  and more involved formulas it might be a challenge.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have a hard
  time writing anything legible with Pencil (or any other iPad stylus) unless I zoom
  in really close, which can really slow you down.\r\n\r\nAs for presentations.
  You can certainly export your Paper drawings and bring them into Keynote after the
  fact. Paper also has a \"presentation mode\" where you can share the iPad's screen
  to an AppleTV giving an unobstructed view
  of whatever you're drawing/writing without the tool tray."
