message: "I will take a look at the Adonit line. And the sketches I'm i there stead
  in would not be hard-lined, but primarily freehand. (I attached a sample sketch
  from the Paper app as an example.) I want to get the most out of the available tools
  that Paper has to offer (i.e. Sketch and Color tools) but not sure if one stylus
  would lend itself to those tools better than another. I'd also like to be able to
  write and take notes, probably with Evernote Penultimate. Again, like I mentioned
  in my initial post, I loved the Pencil until I found out it wouldn't work with my
  iPad 2. Thanks for the help!"
