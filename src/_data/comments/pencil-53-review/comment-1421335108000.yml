message: "I recently got a Pencil 53 for Christmas. I'm not sure if I should keep
  it; although I like the design, its feel in the hand and the blend feature, I've
  got the impression that it isn't a round product. The eraser should perform its
  action depending on how it is put on the screen (horizontal or vertical); the tip
  is too rubberish and I fear it will wear out in no time; and although surface pressure
  works well, sometimes it seems to have trouble to detect if the side is on the screen,
  and how much. Not talking about these times it doesn't detect the pencil correctly,
  but those are the less.\r\n\r\nAh, and when using watercolor, it doesn't paint like
  a dumb stylus, being more accurate and dense. But this is not a drawback.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I don't understand why procreate doesn't make use of surface pressure, but that's
  other story.\r\n\r\nMichael, is Pencil your main stylus or you prefer using a dumb
  one or your hand?"
