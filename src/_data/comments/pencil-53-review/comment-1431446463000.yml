message: "I've been going all my handwritten notes on an iPad for about 4 years
  now. I find the combination of AluPen and Notes+ works really well for me; the lag
  is hardly noticeable, and with a little practice I've become just as fast writing
  in the close-up window as I was on note paper previously. The main difference is
  friction; the combination stylus/iPad is much smoother than pen/paper, but I got
  used to that really quickly."
