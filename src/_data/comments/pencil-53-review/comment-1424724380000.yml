message: "How's it compare to the old Wacom stylus+tablet? I lost my stylus for
  my older Wacom tablet. It may have been the small version and plugs via sub but
  the pen was battery free and I really enjoyed it. It worked best when wanting to
  do virtual paintings etc and some doodling.\r\n\r\nI still lean towards getting out
  actual paper. But felt like I didn't want to buy a whole new Wacom tablet, I can't
  find a workable replacement pen. So I ordered the pencil, albeit through a,Aron
  with one day shipping and it still isn't here (day 3).\r\n\r\nThanks for such a thorough
  review by the way."
