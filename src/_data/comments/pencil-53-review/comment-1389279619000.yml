  Great. I'm looking forward to your next update very much.

  I had been using pencil as a dumb stylus while waiting to upgrade to the iPad air. In
  comparison to the bamboo, I find that you need very little pressure to use pencil
  which makes it seem more life-like. I actually prefer the tip as just a plain stylus.
  With the same light pressure, the bamboo does not register. On the flip side, the
  bamboo is better weighted and is slightly textured which makes it grippy. The graphite
  pencil is beautiful but too smooth. Wouldn't it be interesting if pencil acted more
  like a real rectangular pencil such as the Generals sketch? Designed to be cut with
  a knife, the chisel point line quality varies as you turn it (that would be cool)....
  Or to use pencil + blend as you would real charcoal!
