message: "Thanks for sharing your experience with a mesh tipped stylus, it's been
  helpful.\r\n\r\nI haven't experienced any major crashes with Paper (or Pencil) yet
  that has caused me to lose work. Although I know others have so you're not alone.
  The worst that's happen to me have been miss triggers with Pencil erasing a line
  after I drew it. Those kinks have gotten much better with software updates.\r\n\r\nOne
  safeguard you could try if duplicating pages becomes a burden is to flip between
  journals and open other pages. I've noticed that doing so forces all the strokes
  you've made to be committed to the page and helps avoid them potentially getting
  lost.\r\n\r\nOnly drawback to this technique is you can't rewind on the page if you
  go back to it after opening another. I think Paper only keeps one page in memory
  at a time and flipping to a new one clears the undo (rewind) history. Same thing
  happens if you force quit the app."
