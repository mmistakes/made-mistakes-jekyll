message: "Thanks for the review. With your help I finally decided to make the leap
  of faith a buy the pencil. So happy that using the side of the main tip now gives
  a wider paint effect on some of the tools (brush, highlighter, brush) and the eraser
  \"sort of knows\" if you want to erase thick or thin. e.g. if you use a corner it's
  thin, if you hold it vertical it's wide. When used in vertical mode it doesn't know
  if you are moving the pencil with the fat or thin orientation but for me that's
  OK. So far I'm really pleased."
