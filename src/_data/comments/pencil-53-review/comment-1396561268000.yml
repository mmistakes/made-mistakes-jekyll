message: "I have to use a screen protector, since I have a toddler that has to
  grab and touch everything. It's pretty smooth- a flat piece of plastic as opposed
  to a film (which I have had no luck with at all). Will this disrupt my use of Pencil?
  The screen as it is now is completely usable with fingers and styli, like there
  is no protection on it.\r\n\r\nI am seriously contemplating buying a pencil... But
  I don't want worn tips mucking up stuff."
