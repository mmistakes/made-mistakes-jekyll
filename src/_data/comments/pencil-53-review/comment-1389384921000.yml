message: "Hi Michael, I had a question. So I've been having that issue with pencil
  marks being mistaken for blend. Do you continue to have that issue? And a few times,
  it won't register lines that I'm trying to make. It's either extremely delayed and
  then it will appear or it won't appear at all. Have you had that issue at all? Basically,
  I just wanted to know if these are issues that I'm just having with my specific
  pencil or if these are kind of universal bugs that all pencil users are experiencing.
  If these are universal issues, you think they'll be taken care of with software
  updates?"
