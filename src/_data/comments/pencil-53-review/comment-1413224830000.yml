message: "Apart from the pencil shading at 47 seconds into the video everything
  else works on my pencil already. I'm wondering if \"surface pressure\" is live already,
  in that it knows when I'm using the wide edge, and perhaps the pencil shading is
  just a feature that didn't quite make surface pressure v1? I can for example do
  the squiggle at 38 seconds in, that starts small and ends huge. Am I right in thinking
  that wasn't possible until recently?"
