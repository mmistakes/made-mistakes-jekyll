  I haven't had much luck writing with Pencil in the Paper app. Like other fat tipped
  styli for the iPad it's far from being a precise utensil. The Adonit styli that
  are made with finer tips and built for detail work/writing would probably be a better
  investment for you if note taking is your primary goal.\r\n\r\nPersonally I find
  all iPad styli incredibly hard to write with. They're great for \"sketch notes\" and
  doodles but they take a lot of practice to get over the lag and precision issues.
  If you're expecting an experience similar to pen and paper you'll most likely be
  disappointed. The technology just isn't there for iPad yet."
