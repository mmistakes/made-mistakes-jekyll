message: "For those experiencing weird quirks with Pencil using the Paper app,
  try the following. Turn off the option to access the iOS Control Center within Apps
  (found under Settings &gt; Control Center). This resolved a lot of issues with me,
  especially when my palm was on the screen.\r\n\r\nIn terms of a question though,
  how long does a charge last for you if you don't use it?\r\n\r\nFor example, I use
  my Pencil rarely but when I have, it's been usable and still charged (even after
  a month of no use). Lately though, I can charge it and if I come back to wanting
  to use it in a couple of weeks, I have to charge it again because it won't connect
  properly. (And it's not a tip issue, as I tried swapping it with a new one and the
  problem persisted.)\r\n\r\nSo now if I want to use it every couple of weeks, I have
  to charge it first, which impedes My workflow of just grabbing it when I need it."
