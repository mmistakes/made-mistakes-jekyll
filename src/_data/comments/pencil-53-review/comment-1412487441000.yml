message: "Hi Michael, is the Pencil that you are using still works perfectly? I
  am considering to get one but just want to make sure the Pencil doesn't break that
  often like the Pogo Connect that you mentioned in another post saying it broke after
  2 months and another in 3 months.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, have you tried the pressure
  sensitive with Pencil which release with the iOS 8 upgrade? (Not really sure if
  it's available already. Sorry).\r\n\r\nThanks!"
