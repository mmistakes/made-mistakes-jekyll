message: "I use a smart cover for my iPad when carrying it around to protect it
  from drops, but no screen protector. The iPad's screen is quite durable and I haven't
  noticed any scratches in the 2 years I've owned it.\r\n\r\nSince I don't use a screen
  protector I can't say if Pencil works well with it. From what I've gathered the
  preferred way to use a stylus is without the protector since it can interfere with
  the tip.\r\n\r\nAs far as purchasing new tips often. It really depends on how hard
  you press. I've worn out both of the tips that Pencil shipped with. They're not
  the most durable I've used, but they're not awful either. If you draw a lot and
  press hard you will go through them pretty fast."
