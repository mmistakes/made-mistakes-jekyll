message: "That's how I work now... use a \"dumb\" stylus for when I don't need Surface
  Pressure or Blend and switch to Pencil when I do. It helps preserve the tips.\r\n\r\nThe
  accidental blends seem to be a side effect of not pressing hard enough. When Paper
  doesn't get that input from Pencil it thinks it is your finger and then Blends.
  The software has certainly gotten better over the past year. I've seen it mistakenly
  erase or smudge something but after following through with the stroke it auto corrects
  and removes those mistaken marks.\r\n\r\nIt's by no means perfect but if you trust
  the software to do the right thing, it usually does."
