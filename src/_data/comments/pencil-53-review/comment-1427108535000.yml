message: "Hi Michael, I am more of a part time pencil and paper user and so my
  first tip is still in use after six months. I find, like you that there are occasional
  times when pencil chooses to blur rather than draw and even worse, times when it
  erases at random. both these things might be wear and tear on the tip looking at
  your article here, what do you think? I find it useful to work with a dirt cheap
  basic stylus and keep pencil near the iPad to fool it into thinking I am using pencil
  this way I can smudge but not use surface pressure, hopefully saving my tip."
