message: "I've had a lot of success with Notability + newer Wacom stylus.  The
  newer ones have cloth on the tips, which helps with that rubber-on-glass drag. Plus
  notability has a zoom feature with palm rejection. I take all my notes for school
  that way. The zoom feature on Notability shows you the page you're writing on as
  well as the zoomed in section, so you can write precisely and see the results at
  the same time."
