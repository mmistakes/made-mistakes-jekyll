message: "Hi!  Thanks for your helpful article.  I recently purchased a GTX 970 for this very purpose; however, I do not want to buy an enclosure, but rather mount it open air, so as to have a clean look and occupy myself with a neat, unique project!  I am confused, however, on what exactly the PCIe solution would be for someone in my position.  I'm not sure how the card would be connected via Thunderbolt, or where the Thunderbolt conversion would occur for that matter.  Any advice? Thanks!"
