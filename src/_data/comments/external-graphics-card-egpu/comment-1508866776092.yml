message: "Hi Poul,\n\nI have an mpcie egpu setup with an exp gdc beast adapter; radeon 6770 as the card. A 6770 is a little outdated obviously, but before upgrading I wanted to know if you still think EVGA cards are the best option to go with, and how important you think it is now with windows 10? Thanks in advance!"
