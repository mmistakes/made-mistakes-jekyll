message: "Hi Ali\n\nThe required stuff in addition to what is on the list is this:\n* PCIe riser, I recommend [these](http://www.moddiy.com/products/PCI%252dExpress-PCI%252dE-8X-to-16X-Riser-Card-Flexible-Ribbon-Extender-Cable-w%7B47%7DMolex-%252b-Solid-Capacitor.html) (I use them myself)\n* A modular ATX PSU, take a look [here](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=modular+atx+psu)\n\nIn addition I would get the smallest mini-itx case that can house a full size graphics card. I have used something like [this](http://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=210) before and that includes the ATX power supply. Not sure it can take the biggest graphics card, but you get the idea :)\n\n/Poul"
