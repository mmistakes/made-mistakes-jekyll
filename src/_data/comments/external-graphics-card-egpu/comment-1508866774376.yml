message: "Hi Remy\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you want to connect the GTX 970 to af Thunderbolt enabled laptop. For this you need something like the AKiTiO Thunder2 since it contains a Thunderbolt 2 to PCIe adapter. If you do not want the enclosure you can always take the small board out and have it open air, I did just that in my post [here](/projects//egpu-case-built-around-akitio-thunder-2-and-sonnet-echo-express-se-ii/). The AKiTiO Thunder2 is the cheapest way to do this.\n\n/Poul"
