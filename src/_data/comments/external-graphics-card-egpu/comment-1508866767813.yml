message: "Hi Asad\n\nIt does seem to be better value because of a lower price point and you get a power brick. The HDMI is just used as a data port for the PCI-e input, it does not make it any better. So you cannot use HDMI for connection, you need a mini PCIe port for this to work. You need to open up the laptop and see if you can get an available mini PCIe slot.\n\n/Poul"
