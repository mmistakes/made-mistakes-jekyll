message: "|- Hi Tyler  Sorry for the late reply, but somehow I missed this comment! I have not tried using another device like a motherboard with a Thunderbolt device like an external device connected to a laptop and have not seen anything like it. The closest I have seen is connecting two laptops together with Thunderbolt where one laptop is using the harddisk of the other, but the laptop is in a slave like mode. That I think is the basic problem, you connect two devices that are acting as masters and I would expect the whole thing to not work.  /Poul"
