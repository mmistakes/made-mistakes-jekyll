message: "Hello there. If you could respond to me I would be ever so grateful. I am going to buy the akitio box and a Nvidia GTX 960. Was wondering if it will fit into it. I am currently considering an evga or asus. I have heard that you need the right size and stuff. and do I need an additional charger supply as well. Would you know. Thank you so much."
