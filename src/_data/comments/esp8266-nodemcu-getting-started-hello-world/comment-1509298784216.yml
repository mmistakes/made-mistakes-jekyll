message: ""Hi Lotus49\n\nYes, the prices have really gone down to nothing on AliExpress! I already have 5 ESP8266 Development boards from there and I keep finding uses for them all the time. For breadboarding they are perfect, the only reason I can see for getting the bare chips is if you want to make your own energy efficient battery powered setup. AliExpress has been my favourite place for inexpensive electronics for the past year.\n\n/Poul""
