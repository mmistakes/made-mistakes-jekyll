message: ""Hi Skyler\n\nI have had no problems with my setup, but it might be related to the power supply. Have you tried to stress test the graphics card in OSX using something like [http://www.geeks3d.com/gputest](http://www.geeks3d.com/gputest)? The reason it works in OSX might be because it is not running at maximum load for longer periods. \n\n&#47;Poul""
