message: "Hi Ildar\n\nDid you connect the D0 to the RST pin? It will not wake up if you didn't. Take a look at my post [here](/projects/esp8266-nodemcu-dht22-mqtt-deep-sleep/).\n\nYou can always reflash the ESP8266 to bring it back, just remember to disconnect the D0 to RST wire and follow my guide [here](/projects/esp8266-development-kit-nodemcu-firmware-update-os-x/).\n\nI am still using this script so it should just work fine.\n\n/Poul"
