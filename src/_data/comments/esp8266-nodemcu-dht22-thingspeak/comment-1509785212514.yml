message: "Hi Poul,\n\nI have a Lolin nodeMCU V3 board and I have custom flashed the board and have included all your mentioned modules. The only thing connected is a DHT22 sensor module on D2 and have connected D0 to RST.  \nI have uploaded your code to `init.lua`, but I'm not seeing any data on my thingspeak channel.  \nI've run `init.lua` while connected to ESPlorer and I'm getting the following error:\r\n```lua\r\n> dofile(\"init.lua\")\r\ninit.lua:54: 'end' expected (to close 'function' at line 52) near ''\r\n```\n\nCould you help me fix this?"
