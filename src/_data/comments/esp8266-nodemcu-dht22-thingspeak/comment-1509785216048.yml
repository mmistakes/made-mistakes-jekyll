message: "Got this up and running tonight as per above but get 0 readings.\n\nHave changed the last line to 2000 as suggested before but still no luck.\n\nThe sensor works as I can get a reading from the DHT module in the consol.\n\nAssuming the code shown has the data line from the sensor going to pin D2 on the nodemcu?\n\nHow do I change the code so the unit doesn't go to sleep to test it works?\n\nMany thanks!"
