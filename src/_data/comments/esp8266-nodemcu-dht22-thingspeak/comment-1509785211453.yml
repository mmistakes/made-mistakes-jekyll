message: "I have used your code as a basis for a monitor I built for my Polytunnel which posts over MQTT to a self-hosted mosquito broker. Thanks for the code - it helped me a lot!\n\nI recently discovered a bug though - if the temperature falls below 0, using the Integer build of NodeMCU means that your temperature string ends up reading something like 0.-2 or, even worse, -1.-2.\n\nI tried a few things to sort it but, frankly, it was giving me a headache so I replaced the image with the floating point build so I didn't need to parse the temp string at all.\n\nHope this is helpful and thanks again for publishing your code"
