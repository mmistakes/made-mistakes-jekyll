message: "Do you have a public repo somewhere for me to look at?\r\n\r\nHave you loaded
  the actual font files as well? Just changing the name in the CSS won't work unless
  it's a system font (Arial, Verdana, Georgia, Courier, etc) that is already installed.\r\n\r\nI'm
  using Google webfonts and a script is placed in the head of the `default.html` layout
  that loads the appropriate fonts. Then those are referenced in `_variables.scss` by
  family name.\r\n\r\nDepending on what font(s) you're using you can either use a font
  service (Google, Typekit, Fontdeck, etc) that hosts them for you and just include
  their script in your templates. Or if you have the rights to embed fonts that you
  own you can use a service like [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) to convert them for embedding."
