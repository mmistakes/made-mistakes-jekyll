  I have the opposite challenge ... getting kramdown to process text inside a
  `<details>` tag. I would prefer not to drop into html when writing `<details>`.
  The solution I've come across is <http://movb.de/jekyll-details-support.html>.
  This plugin works great, but it is not supported by github pages, so I have to
  transfer my whole `_site` to github. Have you come across a kramdown extension
  that says "hey kramdown, process me!".
