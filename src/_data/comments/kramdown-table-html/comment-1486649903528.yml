message: "Have you looked at the [`markdownify` filter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/)? I use it to do something similar to place Markdown text inside of a `figcaption` element.\r\n\r\nThere's several ways to handle this without the need of a plugin. You could do something like this with a Liquid `capture`:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% capture your_md %}Here is some Markdown you'd like to **capture**.{% endcapture %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inject the captured variable into whatever you want and add the Markdownify filter so Kramdown processes it like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<details>\r\n  {{ your_md | markdownify }}\r\n</details>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would give you the following HTML output:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<details>\r\n  <p>Here is some Markdown you'd like to <strong>capture</strong>.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to bother with all the captures you could build your own [Jekyll include](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/#passing-parameters-to-includes) that you could pass text through as a `parameter` to be Markdownified."
