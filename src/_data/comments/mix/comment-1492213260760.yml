message: "I haven't used Mix in years and it looks like things might have changed some since I first wrote this up.\r\n\r\nThere are no forums on the Mix/Paper site. It's just a place to share ideas and collaborate by remixing them. To find \"tutorials\" you'll have to follow people who share them. \r\n\r\nSince I'm not really involved with the community much these days not really sure where to start but following 53 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fiftythree) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fiftythree) would be good options. They often feature creators, and I know I've seen various tutorials and such in their feeds. They also do artist takeovers on their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/fiftythree/) if that's more of your thing.\r\n\r\nThe forums I mentioned are the [FiftyThree support](https://support.fiftythree.com/hc/en-us) ones... which looks like they changed too... that's why some of the links were broken.\r\n\r\nI've updated the ones at the end to remedy that. Hope this helps."
