message: "I am not going anywhere once I get on the Mix site.  I can't get anything but public stream and the sites suggested to follow by Mix..no forums and none of the tutorials or things you  mention above.  On my iPad all the folders are different and all are private. I don't know how to make them public.  Could you  do a tutorial that goes into the actual step by step procedures? \r\nThe two links above that say \"Using...\" go to \"Oops!\" pages\r\nI tried the 53 support forum but got into another dead end.\r\nThanks."
