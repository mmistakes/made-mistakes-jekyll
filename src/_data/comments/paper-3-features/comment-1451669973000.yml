message: "Agree about all the note taking features added, I use none of them and
  prefer more powerful apps like Evernote for that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThe journal
  UI switch is a matter of preference I think. I don't disagree that Paper had some
  growing pains when 3.0 launched, but most of those have been addressed in recent
  updates. I personally like to organize my thousands of sketches into a few journals
  vs. hundreds of smaller journals. I accept that I'm not the norm since I seriously
  doubt the average Paper user has as many sketches as I have. Being able to scroll
  throw a grid view to find something is way more usable then the old tedious way
  of flipping page by page if you ask me. And even if I broke a journal of 100+ pages
  into several smaller ones you now have the added problem of remembering what journal
  you stuck a sketch in.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not even addressing the problems with the
  old journals and how they'd often accidentally flip to a new page when drawing near the canvas' edge. Sure the Moleskine look is gone but if you ask me that
  was a necessary change to make the app usable on both iPad and iPhone.\r\n\r\nAt
  the end of the day I care most about how the actual pens, pencil, and watercolor
  tools function. None of that was messed with. Everything else is either icing
  on the cake or a distraction depending on your perspective. If you don't like the
  social stuff don't use it, note taking and picture import... don't use it.\r\n\r\nI get
  why people are upset with the core stuff being changed or removed, but the addition of new tools
  and features? Not a big deal if you ask me.\r\n\r\nThats a bummer on the Book printing feature being killed.
  I wrongly assumed it was still available since there's an option to \"Print Book\"
  when in journal view, but it just goes to a currently unavailable page. Not sure if that's permanent or what."
