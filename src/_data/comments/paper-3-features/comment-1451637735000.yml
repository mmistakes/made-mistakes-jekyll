message: "I owe you a debt of gratitude for this blog, but I'll come right out
  and say that this sounds like sponsored PR hogwash to me. When I got my fifty three
  pencil I decided to learn how to draw all over again more naturally (without layers).
  I'd had paper before the pencil, I'd used it before and it was great, but pairing
  Paper with pencil took the experience to a whole new level. Making strokes with
  the tip, flipping it over to erase, blending and even using palm grip (I'd never
  used palm grip in my life. Not even with real pencils) and then there was the time
  you could export and get your journal printed. How awesome was that? Say what you
  will about the journals, they are most impressive (And really? You'd draw in the
  same journal for a year?) Paper didn't feel like an app. It felt like...Paper. Real
  paper. Now all that is gone, and it's been replaced by this...ordinary note taking
  app which is fine (because I found a backed up older version and reinstalled it).
  My point I do not believe there's an artist alive who experienced the magic of paper
  and is excited by features that existed in MS paint. The new features are more geared
  towards note taking than artistic expression - spotlight, annotation etc... Paper
  is not paper anymore. It's just another soulless app. A big big shame."
