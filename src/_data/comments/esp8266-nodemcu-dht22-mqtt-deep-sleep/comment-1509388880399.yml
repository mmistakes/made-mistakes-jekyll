message: ""Hi Jeffilein\n\nThanks for the feedback, I will take a look at modifying the script as soon as I find the time. You can try using the precompiled DHT22 library as I have described [here](/projects/esp8266-nodemcu-dht22-custom-modules-firmware/), the setup has been running stable for 3 weeks logging every minute. The setup is powered by the wall socket so it might exhibit the same problems when running from batteries which I do plan to test. Fluctuations in power might be the cause here as described in the comments in [this](http://www.bntdumas.com/2015/07/23/how-to-battery-powered-temperature-and-humidity-sensors/) post. Re-reading the data sheet for the DHT22 I noticed the following: Power's voltage should be 3.3-6V DC. When power is supplied to sensor, don't send any instruction to the sensor within one second to pass unstable status. One capacitor valued 100nF can be added between VDD and GND for wave filtering.  n\nSo to solve the instability I might need to add a capacitor which I have ordered to test this out.\n\n/Poul""
