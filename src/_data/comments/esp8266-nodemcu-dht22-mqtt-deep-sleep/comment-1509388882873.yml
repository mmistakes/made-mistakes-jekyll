message: ""Hi Poul  \nGreat project\r\nMy only issue with this config is that the ESP8266 wont send any more MQTT messages when its broker was unanvailable during one send attempt. I.e. if I reboot the broker I also have to power cycle the ESP8266.. Do you get the same behavior on yours? Any ideas how to fix this?  \nThx Seb""
