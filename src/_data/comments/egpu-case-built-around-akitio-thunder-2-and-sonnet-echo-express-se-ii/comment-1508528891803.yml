message: "RE: This is high on my list of gadgets to get this year!  \nSame here ;-).\n\nI am hoping I wlll be able to use it from my desktop Windows PC.\n\nMy PC has an Asus Z87 Deluxe/Dual which has two Thunderbolt1 ports. I bought this motherboard at the time because it has Thunderbolt 1. Unfortunately this motherboard does not have a Thunderbolt Header.\n\nI did not know at the time I bought this motherboard that Thunderbolt1 and 2 PCIe Expansion Cards require a connection between the Expansion Card to a Thunderbolt Header.\n\nI was hoping that perhaps Thunderbolt 3 expansion cards would improve technology and drop the requirement for a Thunderbolt Header and find a more common way to send whatever information passes through the Thunderbolt Header to the card.\n\nI found one article about an Asus Thunderboilt 3 expansion car so far but it looks like it still requires a Thunderbolt Header connection.\n\nThe requirement for a Thunderbolt Header on the motherboard is so frustrating because it means I cannot purchase an expansion card to upgrade my Motherboard to Thunderbolt 3\n\nIt looks like I am stuck with Thunderbolt 1 Pcie 2.0x4 speed and will need to purchase a Thunderbolt 1/2 to Thunderbolt3 adapter to use the Akitio Thunder3 egpu from my PC.\n\nAkitio told me that they do not supply any PC to Thunder3 egpu docks.\n\nIt is very difficult to get any information about exactly what the Thunderbolt Header does or why it is needed.\n\nDo you have any thoughts/knowledge on this?\n\nBye."
