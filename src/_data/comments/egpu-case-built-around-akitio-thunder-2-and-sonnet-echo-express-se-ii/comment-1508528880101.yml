message: "|- Hi Tanakrit  Thank you! I have considered to solid acrylic to cover it up, it would be very easy since OpenBeam supports 3mm in the slots, see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;static1.squarespace.com&#47;static&#47;5282a564e4b0a4dfed512886&#47;52834881e4b0fe186d0c8632&#47;52834886e4b0b6e93a796422&#47;1422001756453&#47;IMG_4768.JPG?format=2500w" rel="nofollow">here<&#47;a>. But at the same time,the exoskeleton keeps the whole thing very cool, but the 200mm fan should be able to take care of any heat the GTX 9xx series generate with the acrylic covers.  &#47;Poul"
