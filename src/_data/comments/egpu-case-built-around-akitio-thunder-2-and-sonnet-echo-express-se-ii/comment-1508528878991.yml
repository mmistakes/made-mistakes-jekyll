message: ""Hi Si\n\nThank you! I was missing eGPU specific enclosures so why not make it yourself I thought. I have modified it further so I now have embedded two laptop power supply units in the case, one for my retina macbook pro and one for my Lenovo t430s. \n\n<img src=\"https:&#47;&#47;odd-one-out.serek.eu&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;04&#47;Powercube-mod-e1429431759279.jpg\" alt=\"eGPU case with powercube mod\" &#47;>\n\nI fitted a PowerCube power strip (1) with some short cables to the ATX PSU (4), the macbook charger (2) and the Lenovo charger (3). The only power cable is the one connected to the PowerCube (5). It is not pretty, but I have less cable clutter around the case :)\n\nI got mine from the German Amazon site since I could not find any in the UK, they still have a few in stock, see <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.de&#47;Akitio-Thunder2-PCIe-Erweiterungsgeh&auml;use-T2PC-TIA-AKTU&#47;dp&#47;B00NQ23TCU?tag=oddoneout0c-21\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>.""
