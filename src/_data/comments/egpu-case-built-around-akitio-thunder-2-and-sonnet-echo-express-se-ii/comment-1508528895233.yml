message: ""Hi, \n\nI am really dissapointed they didn't include a thunderbolt 2 input as well as the thunderbolt 3. \nI would have bought one immediately if they did that. \nHardly anyone has thunderbolt3 as far as I can see, \n\nHow about buying the node, and fitting the Akitio Thunder2 board into the Node, and then perhaps selling the Thunderbolt3 card? \n\nI just bought a second hand Powercolor R9 Nano for &pound;270 to fit in my Akitio Thunder 2 which I bought recently by the way. \ I will let you know how it goes for me ... I will be testing it from an Asus Z87 Deluxe Dual Motherboard with Thunderbolt 1, from an Asus Z97 Deluxe Motherboard with Thunderbolt 2 and finally running from an Asus G751JL on Windows10 hopefully with AMD XConnect ... which is a long shot since I believe Xconnect is Thunderbolt3 only.\n\nNow I am off shopping for a small 200Watt power supply that can drive the 8 pin power Socket of the R9 Nano. \nI am trying to keep everything in the Akitio Thunder2 box. \nWish me luck... I will need it ;-).""
