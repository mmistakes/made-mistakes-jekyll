message: ""Hi Colesdav\n\nYes I have seen it. It is not compatible with a Thunderbolt 1&#47;2 host device, but if one had a Thunderbolt 3 device that is compatible with eGFX then this *might* be my recommendation. It is not compatible with macOS, but should be with Windows as described <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.akitio.com&#47;blog&#47;articles&#47;akitio-thunderbolt3-devices-macbook-pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>. The reason that I do not recommend it at the moment is\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Few Thunderbolt 3 laptops are eGFX compatible<&#47;li>\n\t<li>For that price range hot-plugging needs to work - not sure it does on every device.<&#47;li>\n\t<li>There is no Thunderbolt 3 passthrough, which means the Node needs to be the last device in a chain. All those old Thunderbolt 1&#47;2 devices cannot sit in between.<&#47;li>\n\t<li>I am disappointed about the missing USB &#47; ethernet ports - the Razer Core has these and it saves a Thunderbolt docking station<&#47;li>\n\t<li>It is missing a SATA &#47; M.2 slot for a harddisk. This would complete the device as all the games you cannot play anyway without the AKiTiO Node would not take space up on the laptop.<&#47;li>\n<&#47;ul>\n\nBut for $300 I would still get it if I owned a compatible device.\n\n&#47;Poul""
