message: "Hi Colesdav\n\nYes I have seen it. It is not compatible with a Thunderbolt 1/2 host device, but if one had a Thunderbolt 3 device that is compatible with eGFX then this *might* be my recommendation. It is not compatible with macOS, but should be with Windows as described [here](https://www.akitio.com/blog/articles/akitio-thunderbolt3-devices-macbook-pro). The reason that I do not recommend it at the moment is\n\n* Few Thunderbolt 3 laptops are eGFX compatible\n* For that price range hot-plugging needs to work - not sure it does on every device.\n* There is no Thunderbolt 3 passthrough, which means the Node needs to be the last device in a chain. All those old Thunderbolt 1/2 devices cannot sit in between.\n* I am disappointed about the missing USB / ethernet ports - the Razer Core has these and it saves a Thunderbolt docking station\n* It is missing a SATA / M.2 slot for a harddisk. This would complete the device as all the games you cannot play anyway without the AKiTiO Node would not take space up on the laptop.\n\nBut for $300 I would still get it if I owned a compatible device.\n\n/Poul"
