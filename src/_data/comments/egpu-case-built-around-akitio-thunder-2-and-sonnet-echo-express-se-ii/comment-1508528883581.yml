message: "Hello Alcarinquei\n\nIt should work just fine with Thunderbolt 3, in fact Thunderbolt 3 officially support external graphics cards as described [here](https://thunderbolttechnology.net/blog/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-does-it-all). So any company can make external graphics card enclosures that should work just fine with the Dell XPS. And as far as I can see it also supports Optimus so the internal display should also be able to be used. I would check out [https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/]() to see what other people are doing with the Dell XPS in regards to external graphic cards before buying anything, I don't think there are any posts or guides at the moment, but it is just a matter of time.\n\n/Poul"
