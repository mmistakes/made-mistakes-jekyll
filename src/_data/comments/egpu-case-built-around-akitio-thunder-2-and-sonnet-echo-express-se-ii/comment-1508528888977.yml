For a small build you might want to play around with the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Dell-OptiPlex-D220P-01-ADP-220AB-ZVC220HD12S1&#47;dp&#47;B00CFGVWXG" rel="nofollow">DELL DA-2<&#47;a> power brick which is 220 watts total. Take a look at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;108-enclosures-and-adapters&#47;" rel="nofollow">this<&#47;a> forum for inspiration, at contains many post specifically to eGPU enclosures and adapters. The DELL DA-2 is described in <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;7377-220w-dell-da-2-ac-adapter-discussion&#47;" rel="nofollow">this<&#47;a> post.  You might also want to consider taking the PCB out and putting it in a slightly larger enclosure to be able to fit everything inside, like a small mini-itx case.  &#47;Poul"
