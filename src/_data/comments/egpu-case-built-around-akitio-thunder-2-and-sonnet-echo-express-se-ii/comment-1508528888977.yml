message: "Hi Colesdav\n\nThe 120 watt power supply connected to the AKiTiO Thunder2 will let you only use 75 watts from the PCIe port on the AKiTiO. For a small build you might want to play around with the [DELL DA-2](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-OptiPlex-D220P-01-ADP-220AB-ZVC220HD12S1/dp/B00CFGVWXG) power brick which is 220 watts total. Take a look at [https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/108-enclosures-and-adapters/](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/108-enclosures-and-adapters/) forum for inspiration, at contains many post specifically to eGPU enclosures and adapters. The DELL DA-2 is described in [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/7377-220w-dell-da-2-ac-adapter-discussion/) post.\n\nYou might also want to consider taking the PCB out and putting it in a slightly larger enclosure to be able to fit everything inside, like a small mini-itx case.\n\n/Poul"
