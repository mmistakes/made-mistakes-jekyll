message: ""Hi, \n\nI read through this thread again and looked at your recommendation on the Dell 220W power DA-2 power supply. I could purchase a DA-2 here for around &pound;50.00  However it looks like the pins on the DA-2 output connector needs modding with additional expense for cable modification &#47; rewiring &#47; time to do the soldering etc ,,. etc and I could not face doing it. Especially with the risk of messing up and blowing a GPU due to an incorrect power connection. \ Looking at Corsair Web Site they recently introduced the following two power supplies. The Corsair SF450 (~&pound;80) and Corsair SF600 (~100). These are Small Form Factor (SFX) PSU's.for a small PC build and have all of the outputs required with cables. I decided on a SF600, so that I could easily run 2 Nano's in Crossfire over two akitio boxes. \n\nI could also  drive a a GPU Watercooling unit if I decide to watercool the nano's needed and also I now have a spare PSU for my next PC build. I get the feeling the scope of this project is starting to get out of control in my mind ;-).""
