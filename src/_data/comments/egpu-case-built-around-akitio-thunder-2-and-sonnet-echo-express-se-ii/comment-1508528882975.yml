message: "|- Hello,  Do you think such an installation also work with newer laptop with TB3 such as the dell XPS 13'inch? Or is there a chance that Dell is going to propose an external eGpu to it?  The XPS looks like it has everything to it, light and powerful, good screen. It is just missing a good gpu :)  Thank you for your posts"
