message: "Hi Poul,\n\nThank you kindly again for your response.  \nHere are my replies.\n\n\nRE: 1)1. response above. Looking at the AMD R9 Nano, it appears that it would require roughly 186 Watts peak power running an external UHD monitor during gaming.  \n([http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/amd-radeon-r9-nano,review-33301-9.html]()).\n\nPcie Port should draw 75Watts max to keep witin the Pcie Spec so clearly I would need the 120W Power Brick connected to the Akitio box.\n\nRE: 1).2. response above. Yes I understand that additional power would need to be supplied into the Akitio Box. AMD Cards I have seen usually have 1 or two 6/8 pin connectors. placed at the end of the PCB. This additional power connection would likely have to be accessed through the top of the existing Akitio box. I  in the case of the R9 Nano it looks like an additional 120W power supply might be enough to power the card through the power connector on the card.\n\nRE: If you have a Thunderbolt 3 enabled device then you can get what you want with basically any card using something like the Razer Core.  \nUnfortunately I own nothing with thunderbolt 3 interface."
