message: ""Hi Colesdav\n\n1) A few will fit, but there are a few issues with the ones you mention.\n<ol>\n\t<li>First the cards typically draw more than 75 watts of power and need one or two auxiliary 6-pin &#47; 8-pin connectors. The AKiTiO Thunder2 cannot supply more than 75 watts of power through the PCIe port (25 watts normally, 75 watts with an upgrade 120 watts power brick) and you cannot use these cards without getting som more power into the case.<&#47;li>\n\t<li>Secondly the 6-pin &#47; 8-pin connectors are typically located on the top of the card and these is not room enough to fit these inside the AKiTiO Thunder2. <&#47;li>\n<&#47;ol>\nIf you use a small form factor card that only draws power from the PCIe port and upgrade the power brick of the AKiTiO Thunder2 then it should be possible. If you have a Thunderbolt 3 enabled device then you can get what you want with basically any card using something like the <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.razerzone.com&#47;press&#47;detail&#47;press-releases&#47;pre-orders-start-today-for-the-razer-core-the-worlds-first-plug-and-play-thunderbolt-3-external-graphics-enclosure\" rel=\"nofollow\">Razer Core<&#47;a>.\n\n2) I use NVIDIA cards since they support Optimus which means it is very easy to beam the video signal from the graphics card back to the laptop and display it on the internal screen, take a look at my post <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;odd-one-out.serek.eu&#47;external-graphics-card-egpu&#47;\">here<&#47;a>. So with NVIDIA cards you don't need and external monitor at all! AMD cards are just fine if you use an external monitor.\n\n3) Since Thunderbolt exposes the PCIe bus it should work just fine. It has been done with two NVIDIA cards in SLI <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;6741-2013-13-macbook-pro-2-x-titan_z16gbps-tb2-akitio-thunder2-osx1010-nesone&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a> and two AMD cards in Crossfire <a href=\"https:&#47;&#47;www.techinferno.com&#47;index.php?&#47;forums&#47;topic&#47;6745-2014-15&rdquo;-macbook-pro-2x-r9_280x16gbps-tb2-netstor-na211tb-win81osx-goalque&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<&#47;a>.\n\n&#47;Poul""
