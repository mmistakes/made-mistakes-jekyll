message: "Hi.\n\nGreat work. Very impressive. I have a few questions for you though. \n\n(1). New small form factor GPU's are available for ITX cases. Would they fit directly in the Akitio case? for example. \n\n(A). NVIDIA: Gigabyte GV-N970IXOC-4GD - GeForce GTX 970 4GB Graphics Card GDDR5 PCI-E HDMI/DisplayPort/DVI-D/Dual-Link DVI-I  \n[http://www.guru3d.com/articles-summary/gigabyte-geforce-gtx-970-oc-mini-itx-review.html]()\n\n(B). AMD: R9 Nano. \n[http://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/amd-radeon-r9-nano-review,1.html]()  \n[http://www.hardwareslave.com/reviews/hardware/graphics/sapphire-radeon-r9-nano-review/]()\n\n2. Whilst I am on the subject of AMD. Any reason you focus on NVIDIA Cards? Have you tried an AMD Card?\n\n3. And finally. New AMD Cards no longer need a Crossfire Bridge in normal Pcie setup. Do you think it possible to have two AMD cards connected via two separate Akitio thunder2 boxes via thunderbolt and run crossfire on two R9 Nanos? You might be surprised. AMD might even help you try this out if you contact them and ask. Good game to test Crossfire on is Crysis 3.\n\nGood luck."
