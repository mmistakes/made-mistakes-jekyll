message: ""All the components I need should be here by next Tuesday. I will be spending quite a bit of time testing the R9 Nano, especially the memory (it's 4GB of HBM1) befoie I accept the second hand card card is o.k. I will then be in a position to post some pictures and benchmark results if you or other egpu users are interested in the results. Let me know if you want me to make the data available somewhere. I will likely post the data on my Steam and Plays.TV&#47;Youtube accounts. \n\nThanks again for all of your input and help with this project so far.""
