message: "|- Hi,  Thanks for the very informative writeup on your projects! I want to make something similar for my Mac Mini and want it to be as compact as possible. You mentioned going with a smaller modular PSU. Did you ever get one? If not, what would you recommend? I plan on powering a GTX 980 video card.  Thanks again!"
