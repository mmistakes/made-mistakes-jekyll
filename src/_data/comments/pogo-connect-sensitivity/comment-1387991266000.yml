message: "much appreciate the in depth analysis! finally doing research myself
  upon receiving a 1.0.4 firmware pen. I wanted to exchange it for a 1.1 so I can
  upgrade to the latest 1.3.2 or so, but these articles make me think twice. strange
  that the sensitivity would be so drastically reduced, but it wonder if they've made
  any adjustments within the firmware upgrades to accommodate this prevalent problem."
