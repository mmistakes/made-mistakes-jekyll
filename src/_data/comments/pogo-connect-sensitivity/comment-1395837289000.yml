message: "Thanks for hosting this.

 have an iPad Air, and wanted to get a
  'sensitive' stylus which my Pencil doesn't support (yet?) in Paper so I got a Pogo
  Connect used as I had known about limitations.\r\n\r\nThe odd thing to me at least
  is the ranging firmware versions for this model T1-PGCT-302 as reported by the Pogo
  app. Then I learned that there's a firmware upgrade, from 1.1.0 and beyond, to help
  address this. As while using the Pogo app the sensitivity appears to work as expected,
  I took this as good news that it's just a matter of time until 3rd party apps also
  pick up this support. But my stylus firmware was 1.0.1 and there's no upgrade path.
  I'm working with them in hopes towards an upgrade - they have good promotions IFF
  you've got purchase receipt of their item *new* which I'm hoping they'll transfer
  to me. Time will tell.\r\n\r\nI should point out that several retailers are selling
  this pen somewhat discounted from list which leads me to think that there's inventory
  out there at earlier than 1.1.0 firmware, so if you're out there with a mini or
  full size Air and in the market for this pen - which btw is pretty nice, you might
  want to take a close look at potential unit's firmware --- might be difficult to test
  until you receive one, to ensure you're not left behind"
