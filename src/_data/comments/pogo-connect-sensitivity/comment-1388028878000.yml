message: "If the sensitivity levels you set in the Pogo Connect app actually stuck
  and didn't need to be constantly refreshed it wouldn't be a problem. It appears
  anytime that app is in the background for a certain amount of time it goes to sleep
  and forgets the levels.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the default levels were reduced some
  to work better with the alternate tips that allow less sensitivity to adjust for
  note taking uses."
