message: "Thanks Jim!\r\n\r\nThis is a known problem, check out [TenOne Design's blog](https://tenonedesign.com/blog/t1pogomanager-sdk-v132-for-ipad-air/)
  for more detail.\r\n\r\nThe gist is Apple farted
  around with the technology behind their screens for the new iPad Air and Mini with
  retina, which caused the Pogo Connect to stop working.\r\n\r\nTenOne Design has since
  released an update that partially supports these new screens, but it still has issues.
  I don't have a newer iPad so I can't verify any of this. My guess as to why it works
  in Procreate and the Pogo Connect app is because they're using TenOne Design's newer
  SDK and Paper hasn't updated to it yet."
