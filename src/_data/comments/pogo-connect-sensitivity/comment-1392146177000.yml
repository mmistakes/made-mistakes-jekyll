message: "I finally have to join in here. First, I love this site and Micheal your
  work, explanations and such have been incredibly useful and inspiring.\r\n\r\nI bought
  a Pogo Connect. I love the feel of it on screen, but I do not have any touch sensitivity
  in Paper. i am using an iPad Mini retina and I'm guessing that is part of the problem.
  But it works in Connect app, in Procreate and in Sketch, but not in Paper. Every
  time I go through the process above, Paper's watercolor brush gives me an 1/8 inch
  of finer line, then back to standard.\r\n\r\nIt's been tough following all the blogs
  and support reports to know where things stand... So, right now Feb11, 2014... is
  anyone getting the Pogo to work on a Mini Retina with PAPER?\r\n\r\nP.S. my Pogo
  tip makes a little click when I use it, like the tip is clicking inside?"
