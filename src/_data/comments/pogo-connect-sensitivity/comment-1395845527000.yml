message: "I went through a couple of Pogo's with the older 1.0.1 firmware. They
  kept replacing them for me free of charge because of a design flaw in the tip that
  broke inside.\r\n\r\nThis last Pogo I received appears to have fixed that and it
  has the newer 1.1.0 firmware. Weird thing is it's much less sensitive than before.
  Still not sure if it's the firmware or the extra soldering they applied inside to
  keep the tip from busting off.\r\n\r\nI have seen things improve in 3rd party apps
  as they've updated to newer versions of the Pogo's SDK. But it's still a mess. I
  have to disconnect and reconnect all the time because it flakes out. When the pen
  works it's great, but it's so unreliable."
