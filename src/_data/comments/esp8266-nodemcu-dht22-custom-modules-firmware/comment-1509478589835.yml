message: ""Hi Ender\n\nI think you need to try to re-flash the firmware, it does look like it is flashed correctly or the firmware might be broken. From the error message it cannot even find the \"file\" library. Try another branch and make sure you check the options in my guide. You need to see the correct boot screen before even attempting to get the blink demo working.\n\n/Poul""
