message: ""Hi Sonny\n\nGreat that you can use my code! I have written a new post [here](/projects/esp8266-nodemcu-dht22-thingspeak/){:rel="nofollow"} with a guide on how to upload to ThingSpeak instead. Do you need the code to both upload to a MQTT server and ThingSpeak, or just ThingSpeak?\n\n/Poul""
