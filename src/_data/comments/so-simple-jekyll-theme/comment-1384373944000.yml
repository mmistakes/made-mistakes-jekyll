message: "No worries, doesn't look like you double posted the comment, it only
  came up once.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make the main content column wider you can play
  around `max-width` on the `.entry-content` element. Because the theme is responsive
  that size is in a few locations depending on the width of your browser window (or
  screen if on mobile), so you'll need to adjust accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt's probably
  going to be some work getting all the widths to sort out. I optimized the pages
  for readability and purposely left white space on the left and right so the line
  widths weren't too long. If you do beef up the main content column's width it'll
  screw with the left sidebar and things won't line up right.\r\n\r\nEasiest way to address
  that would be to make the sidebar 1 column that spans the entire width (see what
  I did on small screen sizes for ideas). You might have to increase the `max-width`
  on `.entry-wrapper` as well to get everything to fit.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
