message: "Hi again Michael. Maybe you could shed some light here; I'm trying to
  use [GalleryView](http://spaceforaname.com/galleryview) but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n
  So what I did is this -- installed [GalleryView jekyll
    plugin](https://github.com/mgratzer/GalleryView),
  installed GalleryView itself in a subdirectory of my site, added the lines to call
  the various components of GalleryView (GalleryView JS, jQuery Timers Plugin JS,
  GalleryView CSS) to `_includes/scripts.html` (pointing to the correct directories
  of my site obviously) but the list of photos that is supposed to be taken by the
  javascript and transformed into this cool looking and modern gallery does not appear...
  ie, it displays a plain simple unordered list.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if there's something
  in your theme that prevents these javascripts to work or not (because something
  like this also happened with another plugin I was testing yesterday, again to display
  some sort of photo galleries).\r\n\r\nThanks!"
