message: "If you want buttons to be centered \"globally\" then you''ll need to mess
  around with the `.btn` class in the CSS. If you just want a specific instance of the
  button you could wrap it in a `div` that has CSS to `text-align: center` and that should
  do the trick. If you look at the `.pagination` wrapper that includes the next and
  previous post links and that's how I centered them."
