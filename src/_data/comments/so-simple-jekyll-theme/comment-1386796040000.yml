message: "Doesn't look like it's loading the Disqus script, which is really odd
  because if it worked locally and nothing changed I don't know why it wouldn't on
  the live server.\r\n\r\nYou could try removing the Liquid if statements in `scripts.html`
  include and force it to load the script.\r\n\r\nChange\r\n\r\n`{% if site.disqus_shortname
  and page.comments %}{% include disqus_comments.html %}{% endif %}`\r\n\r\nto `{% include
  disqus_comments.html %}` and see if the script loads."
