message: "Sure no problem, this is a fairly easy one to fix.\r\n\r\nIf you add a
  `display: block` declaration to `.entry-feature-image` along with a `max-width` you should
  be all set.\r\n\r\nI did a quick test in Google's Developer Tools on the theme demo
  site and it appeared to resize and center the image just fine."
