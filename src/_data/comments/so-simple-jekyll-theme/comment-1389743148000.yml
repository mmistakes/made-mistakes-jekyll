message: "So I got everything to work now! At least locally, I still need to understand
  how to push the compiled site up on github.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's what I did:\r\n\r\n1,
  added the js stuff required by GalleryView inside `page.html` and `post.html` in the
  `<head>` section, right after `{% include head.html %}`. I've left jquery 1.7.1
  which is compatible with all the things in your template, so no need for 1.9.1 which
  effectively makes GalleryView fail.\r\n2 `_includes/scripts.html` is same as before
  now, except for the jquery line which is commented out.\r\n\r\n(Little update of
  the day after)<br />To push only the compiled source (=content of `_site`) I wasn't
  able to follow the instructions given.\r\n\r\nBut I've found a [nice
    script](https://github.com/balevine/jekyll-deploy) that makes the magic for me so it may help others\r\n\r\nAnd finally [this is an
      example](http://aadm.github.io/2013-11-22-ciao-alfonsine.html) where you can see GalleryView in action."
