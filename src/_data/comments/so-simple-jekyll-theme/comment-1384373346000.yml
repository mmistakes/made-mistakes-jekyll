message: "Michael sorry if you see this post again. I think I've had a problem with
  my Disqus account and believe my comment didn't go through -- in case it's awaiting
  moderation then I'm sorry -- delete either one.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to thank you for
  this template which I love.\r\n\r\n
  However I'm not able to do much with CSS etc so I wonder if you could give me an
  help to enlarge the default column width and associated images because they are
  all shrunk down to `640px` or so while I'd like my photographs BIG (`800px` wide big)."
