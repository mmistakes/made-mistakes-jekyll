message: "Just a quick question before I take a closer look at the GalleryView
  plugin. Are you hosting your site on GitHub pages? I ask because you mentioned you've
  had problems with other plugins. GitHub pages doesn't currently support any Jekyll
  plugins, so that would explain why they're not working for you.\r\n\r\nTo use them
  you have to generate your Jekyll site locally first and then deploy the files in
  `_site`"
