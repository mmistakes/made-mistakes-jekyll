message: "So close. My guess is using jQuery 1.7.1 broke something with the responsive
  nav script and it's not triggering a few CSS classes that hide and show it based
  on screen size. If you don't care about that you could strip it out and remove
  some CSS styling. If you inspect `nav` element and the lists inside it you should
  be able to spot the CSS that needs modifying.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a few `display:
  none`s in there that is hiding the nav that could be taken out.\r\n\r\nOr check
  the [Responsive Nav's site](ttp://responsive-nav.com) for a possible fix."
