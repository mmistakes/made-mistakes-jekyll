message: "I know enough Javascript to be dangerous so I might not have a 100% solution
  for you. But the problem is certainly from the GalleryView scripts not loading properly
  because of a conflict.\r\n\r\nFor starters you're loading 2 versions of jQuery that
  might be causing the problem. I'm using 1.9.1 with the theme and then you're loading
  1.7.1 after that (only use one version). No idea on how current the GalleryViewscript
  is so it might not work with 1.9.1. And if you use 1.7.1 instead it might break
  something with the theme. You'll have to experiment and adjust the scripts as necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso
  I would comment out `<script src=\"{{ site.url }}/assets/js/scripts.min.js\"></script>`
  just while you're troubleshooting. It's possible the GalleryView scripts are conflicting
  with something in there, namely FitVids since I noticed a reference to it in your
  console, but my money is on a jQuery conflict.\r\n\r\nOther than these suggestions
  I don't have much else to offer about fixing scripts. It's not really my expertise."
