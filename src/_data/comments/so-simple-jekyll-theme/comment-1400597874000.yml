message: "Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nThanks for the response! I think it was a Facebook
  cache issue. I had originally thought that might be the case, but then when 4.5
  hours went by and it still wasn't working I began to think it wasn't a cache issue.
  When I woke up this morning everything was cool. However, when I use Facebook's
  developer tool for object debugger I am getting an error: Object at URL of type
  `article` is invalid because the given value `/index.html` for property `og:url`
  could not be parsed as type `url`. Doesn't appear to be influencing Open Graph behavior,
  so I think we are all set! Sorry to bug you. Thanks for making such awesome themes!"
