message: "Great theme. I appreciate all the hard work. However, I'm having issues
  with Open Graph posting the description of pages incorrectly into Facebook. It keeps
  posting, \"A simple and clean responsive Jekyll theme for words and photos,\"\r\n\r\nAll the other OG meta-tags work fine. It is just :\r\n\r\n`<meta property=\"og:description\"
  content=\"{% if page.description %}{{ page.description }}{% else %}{{ site.description
  }}{% endif %}\">`\r\n\r\nthat is the issue. I have changed the description of the
  index.html file, and I have double checked the files on Amazon S3, where I am hosting,
  to make sure no old versions of it exist, but it keeps positing the original description.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts? Could this be because the site is too new and I need to wait for crawls
  to occur, etc?"
