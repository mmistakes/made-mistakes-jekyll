message: ""Hi Aadil\n\nI know there are some additional quirks with the 2015 Macbook Pro using eGPU setups as described [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/8212-2015-13-macbook-pro-gtx97016gbps-tb2akitio-thunder2-win81osx1010-tranj10/), but not sure if that also affects the 2015 Macbook Air lineup. Are you running a BIOS setup or UEFI? And what GPU do you use and do you use a powered PCIe riser?\n\n/Poul""
