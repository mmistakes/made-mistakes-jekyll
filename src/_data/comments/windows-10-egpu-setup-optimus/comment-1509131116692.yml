message: ""Much more research later. Turns out the Mid-2013 MBA does-not deal with Thunderbolt properly in EFI Mode. I realised this while installing Win 7. Installing in EFI Mode led to the same issues as 10, but Win7 natively installs in BIOS mode and thats the only way to get the eGPU working on Windows.\n\nHow to get it working\n\n1) Create Windows 10 Install disc using Bootcamp Assistant, update all the drivers etc. Keep this Pendrive aside\n2) Create Windows 7 Install Disc using Bootcamp Assistant\n3) Download Win 7 Bootcamp Drivers from Apple and Copy to Windows 7 Pendrive (Bootcamp Assistant will prompt you)\n4) Copy $WinPEDrivers$ Folder from Win7 Pendrive to Win10 Pendrive (Must do it now, System will reboot after partitioning is complete)\n5) Plug in eGPU into Thunderbolt\n6) Setup Bootcamp Partition using BootCamp Assistant \n7) System will reboot automatically\n8) Remove Win7 Pendrive. Plug in Win10 Pendrive.\n9) Windows Boot Logo/Setup/etc will happen on External Display\n\nThis also means no Optimus, or dual GPU. Only one GPU is detected. The other GPU will show up as a hidden device with Error Code 45.""
