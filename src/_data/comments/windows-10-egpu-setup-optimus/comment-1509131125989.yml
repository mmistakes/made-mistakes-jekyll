message: ""Hey, I had this all working on my macbook air (2013) and then the laptop didn't make it on my move across the world.  Picked up a 2015 model and folllowed the same steps.  Both cards show up, but no matter what I do I can't get anything to run on the eGPU. The one exception is No Man's Sky, which was what I was trying to get going initially, bizarrely it only works if I fully disable the internal GPU. Nothing else works, I can't even get into the Nvidia control panel if the intel is disabled, but somehow the game and egpu work great optimus style on the internal display.  \n\nNo matter what I do, I can't recreate this magic for any other program, and nothing works when the Intel is enabled.  I have no idea how this is technically working at all. very odd.\n\nIdeas?\n\n(Windows seems to make kick in a basic display adapter, but it doesn't show up in device manager...)""
