message: ""Hi Eric\n\nWhat graphics card are you using? I am using one from EVGA and these tend to go more smoothly with these kind of setups. And I am assuming you don't have a discrete graphics card in the MBP. Try to follow the steps described in the section \"Usage\". Be sure to power everything off and disconnect as described. If you are not using an EVGA card the reboot might not be enough during the installation process. And lastly, are you using an external monitor? It is usually easier to get the setup to work using an external monitor first.\n\n/Poul""
