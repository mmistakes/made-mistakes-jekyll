message: "Hi Peter\n\nLets try to troubleshoot, but first I need some additional information.\n\n* What kind of setup are you running?\n* Do you have a NVIDIA graphic card from EVGA?\n* Did you start from a clean Windows 10 install or upgrade from a previous version?\n* Where exactly in the guide are you stuck?\n\n/Poul"
