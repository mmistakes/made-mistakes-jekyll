message: "Hmm, ok lets try one last thing. I am assuming that you have the correct driver (Nvidia 361.75). Since you don't have a EVGA graphics card the steps might be different. I would try the boot steps described [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/9176-2014-15-macbook-pro-iris-gtx97016gbps-tb2-akitio-thunder2-win10-zapcord/).\n> To get Optimus working on Windows 10, install driver version 361.75 released 1/27/2016\nBoot procedure is now:  \n1. plug everything in\n2. start egpu\n3. start laptop\n4. wait 30 seconds\n5. boot"
