message: "Wow! This just solved my problems! I was considering getting Windows 8 so I could use Optimus instead of using an external monitor. But now with this new driver software I don't need Windows 8 and I can continue to comfortably use Windows 10! Thank you so much for this article! I followed your other one on building an eGPU. I have a MacBook Air 2013 and I really wanted a gaming PC without having another computer to worry about. Really changed the way I game! Woohoo! No more fat monitor to carry around! Woohoo for solid frame rates!"
