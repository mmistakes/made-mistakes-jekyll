message: "Hi Utopian\n\nOptimus is what enables the Intel iGPU to display frames from the NVIDIA dGPU or eGPU and switching between these GPU's. The x1 1.0 (250 MB/s) link compression is just a performance boost when the bandwidth is very low in setups like these and it is mostly just a boost to DirectX 9 applications. You need an Intel iGPU, Optimus enabled drivers and the x1 1.0 link to activate the link compression, I have not seen other ways to do this. The bandwidth of Thunderbolt 1 and 2 type setups are much higher so the link compression does not active here.\n\n/Poul"
