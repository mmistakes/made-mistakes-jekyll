message: "I have tried that method. But now matter what, both screens remain off in Win 10. Windows 7 on the other hand works like a charm. Have to boot with it connected and the Windows boot up happens on the external only.\n\nThough now how do I get a dual gpu/screen setup going? The MacBook Air screen remains off when booted off nVidia."
