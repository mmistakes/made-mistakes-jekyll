message: "Hi Jonny\n\nNice videos! :) Just one comment, in your video \"My eGPU setup and what you need to DIY\" you say at around 9:05 that the size of the PCIe riser does not matter and you have a x1 riser. But it does matter up to a certain point, you are limiting the bandwidth to the card by using a x1 riser, you should at least use a x4 or higher.\n\n/Poul"
