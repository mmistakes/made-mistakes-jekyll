message: ""Hi Poul, thanks again for the quick reply. THe gtx 745 is just for testing the set-up (I had one sitting around)...If everything works (akitio, PSU, PSU switcher and powered riser), I am planning to buy  a gtx 970 or 980.  I ordered the pcie riser from moddiy.com similar to the one you mentioned and had on the hyperlink....waiting for it to arrive."""
