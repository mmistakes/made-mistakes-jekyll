message: "Hey Poul, just a short question! Do you know if Nando4's program from techinferno is able to turn of the discrete graphic card of a macbook pro and activate the iGPU? I know that i can't use the eGPU(via Optimus) with the internal Monitor of the MBP if i have a discrete graphic card(in my case GT750M).  \nThanks and Greetings!  \nDavid"
