message: ""Hi Chris\n\nI have not used the adapter to try using Thunderbolt 3 devices on a Thunderbolt 1 / 2 Apple host. You should ask around at [egpu.io](https://egpu.io/forums/) or [Techinferno](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) to be sure. It does seem that it might work as described [here](https://egpu.io/forums/psu-cables/apple-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter/).\n\n/Poul""
