message: "Hi Jonathan\n\nI would take a look at [this](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/topic/8132-2015-15-mbp-r9-m370x-gtx97016gbps-tb2-akitio-thunder2-win81-gatsby/) post for help and asking around there. I do not own a laptop with a dedicated graphic card so it is a bit difficult to help you with this. Basically you need to disable the R9 and enable Intels iGPU for Optimus to work. Using Windows 8.1 and an external monitor is the easiest to setup in my experience.\n\n/Poul"
