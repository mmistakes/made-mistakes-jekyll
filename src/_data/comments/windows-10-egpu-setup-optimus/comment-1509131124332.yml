message: ""Hi I have a Lenovo Y700 and I'm  going to add an eGPU to this laptop. I have bought a Zotac GTX 1070 last week and also ordered a PE4C V3.0 for adding the VAG to my laptop. for running this eGPU, does it need a particular driver or software? or it is plug and play? it would be great if you can help me""
