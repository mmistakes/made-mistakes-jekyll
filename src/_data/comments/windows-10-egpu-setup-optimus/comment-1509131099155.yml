message: ""Hi Poul,\n\nThank you very much for your quick reply. I should get the computer soon and I have a gtx 945 card I can use to test the set-up with an akitio thunder. Since it looks like it is easier to set up that and then connect the ssd with some enclosure to the secondary thunderbolt port...\n\nI will ask around the forum and keep you posted with this project. \nThanks!""
