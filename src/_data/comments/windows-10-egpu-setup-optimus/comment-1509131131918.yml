message: ""Hi guys. I've got an acer aspire r13. I'm considering to buy an egpu, either the acer graphics dock with a gtx 960m via thunderbolt 3, or a thunderbolt 3 expansion box with pcie sockets to use a gtx 1050 ti. I'm just worried that the thunder 3 expansion box with the gtx 1050 ti won't work with my laptop. So is it possible to get a thunder 3 expansion box working with any laptop or what do I have to mind before buying any of these two options? Thanks for your replies!""
