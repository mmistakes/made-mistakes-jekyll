message: "My eGPU setting: EVGA 500W PSU, EVGA GTX 960 4GB, Akitio Thunderbolt 2 PCIE Box, the cable  \nMy Macbook Pro: i7, Intel Iris Pro, 15', win10  \nAfter I finished the installation of drivers and restart, I can find the card in the settings. However, when I ran the software to test it, the drivers will just clash. Details are: after showing FPS 60+, the test just stopped and after I pressed Esc, i find the graphics driver \"clashed and recovered\". Even I tried to reinstall the drivers for many times, it never works. Can anybody help me?"
