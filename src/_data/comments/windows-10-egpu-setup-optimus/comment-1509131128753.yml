message: ""Hi Aadil\n\nI am running out of ideas, hardware wise you have the correct setup and you a using UEFI. Also disabling the HD6000 to make Optimus work also sounds strange since Optimus needs the built-in Intel graphics card. The powered riser should give enough power to the graphics card. TechInferno should be able to help you. You might need to try the setup without the powered PCIe riser since som do not recommend it at TechInferno. The 2015 model might be the problem since the 2015 model Retina Macbook Pro can be tricky using eGPU type setups.\n\n/Poul""
