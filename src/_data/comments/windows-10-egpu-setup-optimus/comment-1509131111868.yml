message: ""I would also wait for the Razer Core if I were you. The adapters are too expensive at the moment and with Thunderbolt 3 eGPU solutions you should get the added bonus of hot-pluggable support. I will also expect that the Razor Core will be my recommendation for Thunderbolt 3 users until something better comes along (I would like a harddisk slot in my eGPU setup).\n\r /Poul""
