message: ""Hello! Thank you for this guide. I'm writing as I am for whatever having an issue with my egpu setup. I'm using the Akitio thunderbolt 2 pcie box with a Nvidia gtx 780 on a MacBook Pro early 2011 model. \n\nI have Windows 10 installed (UEFI mode)\nFirst time booting up into Windows with the egpu plugged in, Windows recognized my GPU and I downloaded the latest drivers. After driver installation completed I restarted the MBP. After restarting back into Windows my GPU is not being recognized. Just the ugly (Intel 3000). The GPU's fans are spinning, the Akitio blue light is on. (I should mention that I altered the Akitio so that my gtx 780 could fit properly and therefore no need for the pcie riser card). Also using a 650w psu with all cables attached to the GPU, as well as a device that plugs into the psu that emulates the \"paper clip trick\"\n\nThings I have tried:\nTurn on MBP holding alt (option) key\nWait for boot menu to come up\nSelect Windows 10 UEFI \nBoot into Windows 10, then plugging in the thunderbolt cable (also tried leaving the thunderbolt cable throughout the whole boot up process). Still no avail. \nTried different combinations of plugging in the thunderbolt cable at different times while also turning on the psu at different times. \nBut Windows will not detect the GPU anymore. Any ideas?""
