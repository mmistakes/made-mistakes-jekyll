message: "|- Hi Poul, Update: got the new computer with thunderbolt 3.0 port and waiting on 1)  PCI-Express PCI-E 16X to 16X Riser Card Flexible Ribbon Extender Cable w/Molex + Solid Capacitor 2) PSU switcher  However I've been reading a few posts that advise against using the powered cable...I guess I will use it to power the akitio + test nvidia gtx745 TI I have (no need to use the plug in the akitio with this set-up, right?) but do you think it would be better to do a conversion of molex to 2.5 plug to power (plus gpu dedicated power) a more powerful card instead of using the pci riser with the molex? Thanks again!"
