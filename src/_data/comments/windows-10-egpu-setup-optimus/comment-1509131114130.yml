message: "I have been trying to get this to work. But it just refuses to work on my Macbook Air.\n\nI have a Aktio 2 with a Zotac 760 running Windows 10 in UEFI mode on my 2013 Macbook Air. If I boot with it connected, I just get a black screen in Windows. External also shows black screen.\n\nBooting without the card, leads to no detection at all.\n\nThough its working perfectly in OSX. Drives the external with ease."
