message: "Hi Francis\n\nI have only used the Windows 10 drivers for a short while, but they should work. You might need to disable the dGPU using a program like Nando's DIY eGPU setup 1.30, but I have seen people having all 3 GPUs active at the same time. I would ask around [here](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) to be sure. If you want to accelerate the internal screen of the laptop then you need Optimus and the iGPU active, but since you already have room to drive both the iGPU and dGPU it should also work with the iGPU and eGPU. \n\nI used to own the Sonnet Echo Express SE II and I had many issues with this. I had problems getting the graphics card detected and this *might* be because of the PCIe multiplexer at work here. This was with a BIOS install of Windows so that might be the problem and you might have no problem at all. Again, I would ask around at [TechInferno](https://www.techinferno.com/index.php?/forums/forum/83-diy-e-gpu-projects/) to see if others can successfully use such a setup. \n\nFor the price you might consider getting two AKiTiO Thunder2, one for the harddisk and another for the graphics card. As far as I remember it is slightly cheaper to get the two AKiTiO Thunder2. \n\nBut based on my own experiences I would recommend getting a much cheaper AKiTiO Thunder2 for the eGPU and get a portable bus-powered Thunderbolt harddisk enclosure for the SSD, something like [this](http://www.akitio.com/portable-storage/neutrino-thunderbolt-edition) but without the SSD. It should also be cheaper and more versatile. I am myself looking for a portable Thunderbolt SSD solution.\n\n/Poul"
