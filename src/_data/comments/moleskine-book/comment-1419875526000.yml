message: "Yes you can save your Paper pages to the Camera Roll. You have to pinch
  the page you want to export so it zooms out some. Then 3 buttons should appear below
  it, the middle one with the Share icon is what you want. Tap that and swipe over
  to the right one screen to reveal the \"Save to Camera Roll\" button."
