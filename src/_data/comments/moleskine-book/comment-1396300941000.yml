message: "Thanks. You should be fairly safe printing outside of Paper's \"book\" feature.
  I've printed 8x10\" images just fine and I know others have blown them up 18x24 as
  canvas prints. There will probably be some artifacts and noise when you enlarge
  past 8x10, but depending on the drawing it might look just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you have
  an iPad with retina screen, images output to your camera roll at 2048Ã—1536 pixels.
  On an iPad mini it's half that."
