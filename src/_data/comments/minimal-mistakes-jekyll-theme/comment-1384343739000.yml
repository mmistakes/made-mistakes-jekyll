message: "I've created a few Jekyll themes after this one so forgive me if I jumble
  this up. They're all starting to blend together to me now ;-)\r\n\r\nThe typography
  in this theme was heavily based off of Typeplate's set of styles. I liked the indents
  and no padding around paragraphs because it mimic the typography of most books,
  which is a feel I was going for.\r\n\r\n[Typeplate](http://typeplate.com) has since dropped support for LESS, so I removed
  it for the most part and incorporated a few mixins as a base to build off of.\r\n\r\nIf
  you're new to CSS then there's a lot going on with the theme that I can't easily
  explain in a comment. To further complicate it I use LESS to build all of the stylesheets,
  which are broken up into smaller chunks and preprocessed to output `main.min.css`.
  That's another layer of abstraction that you'd have to get familiar with on top
  of learning CSS.\r\n\r\nBut if you take a look at the .less files you'll see they're
  much more logical than digging through `main.min.css` which has been optimized for
  speed by removing extra spaces and comments. The .less files have more documentation
  to help customize. For the most part if you bump around `typography.less`, `page.less`,
  and `variables.less` you should be able to do some simple modifications to suit your
  taste."
