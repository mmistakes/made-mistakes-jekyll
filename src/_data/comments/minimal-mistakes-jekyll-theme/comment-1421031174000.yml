message: "It is possible if your CSS skills are strong. It's tricky to do
  multi-leveled navigation with Jekyll but it can be done. I couldn't think of a one-size
  fits all solution to cover every use-case so I purposely kept things simple.
  You can certainly hack something together that would meet your specific needs.\r\n\r\nYou'll likely have to hard code some of the navigation lists rather than relying on data
  files for all of the menus. Unless you want to string together some crazy Liquid
  spaghetti code to do it.\r\n\r\nI'd Google around for some ideas. I know I've seen
  a blog post or two with ways of dealing with tiered and dynamic navigations in Jekyll."
