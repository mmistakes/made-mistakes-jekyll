message: "Anything is possible. You'll have to modify `index.html` to pull in full
  posts instead of just the title and excerpt.\r\n\r\nIf you look at HPSTR you should
  be able to get some inspiration and modify the [homepage code](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/blob/master/index.html) and apply it to the
  Minimal Mistakes theme."
