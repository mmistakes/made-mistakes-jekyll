message: "A simple yet beautiful theme, thanks! However, I would like to be able
  to customize the style a bit, for example I don't like the indent of a new paragraph
  and its close margin to the previous one. So I had to comment out the `\"p+p\"` part
  in `main.min.css`. I'm very new to css, actually I had only spent less than a few
  hours to learn it today, so it was difficult for me to customize it further, e.g.
  to change the font of the posts, without a clear document.\r\n\r\nSo my question
  is that is there a document associated with this `main.min.css` file? Or at least
  can I find a pretty formatted one(formatting it with some tools led me to some errors)?
  I can only guess that it contains something from <git.io/normalize> but they seem very different now, or it a combination
  of other css files too?"
