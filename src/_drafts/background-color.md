## Intro

## Methods of filling the background

### Drag color swatch onto the canvas (quick method)

### Fill the background manually

## Advantages of background quick fill

* It's super quick.
* It's non-destructive.
* You can erase a drawing and not worry about doing a background match.

## Background fill gotcha

* Some of the tools like the watercolor brush and marker behave differently on a dark background. Traditionally they "multiply" color when applied on top. With a background fill they become semi-opaque. Whites and yellows will now show.
