Most of my Paper for iOS time lapse videos were made using [**Reflector**](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) to record the iPad's screen. With some edits done in Adobe AfterEffects to speed things up, include music, and add overlays.

{% notice %}
#### iOS screen recording

Apple has built this feature directly into iOS allowing you to [capture the screen](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935) directly on device.
{% endnotice %}

As long as you have an iPad 2 or newer you can use Reflector. Basically you turn on AirPlay mirroring on the iPad and it lets you beam it over to a Mac or PC running Reflector.

My earlier time lapse videos were sets of screenshots[^screenshot] that I converted into Quicktime movies using iPhoto's slide-show feature. They're not as dramatic looking because you don't see the actual strokes happening, but still neat in a low tech kind of way.

[^screenshot]: Press and hold the iPad's power and home buttons at the same time. You will see a flash and hear the camera's shutter close if done correctly.

I've also experimented with recording the actual drawing process with my iPhone and speeding that up. Removing glare from the iPad's screen was a real challenge for me and I had mixed results with the [final videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqVzqVG0e5g&index=8&list=PLaLqP2ipMLc6UugVLyTwWTiFtmmZzj7ao). For those who have more controlled studio lighting and patience, the results can be quite impressive.
