Writing a book devoted to Paper for iOS would be awesome. Once I finish the next couple of tutorials I want to look into creating an eBook version or possibly a printed version.

I would love to print Moleskine books of the guides using Paper's built-in book feature, but I don't think that will be cost effective. At $50+ a pop that doesn't exactly scream *affordable*.
