Trying to emulate the look and feel of [watercolor on the iPad](/paperfaces/) has inspired me to revisit painting traditionally. I've gone mini in an effort to fit some painting in amongst family and work obligations. 

My plan was to complete a miniature 1.5\" painting a day, but the challenge of painting so small is eating up way too much time. Instead I'm going to keep things casual and let images happen as they happen.

<ul class="gallery-thumbnails">
{% for post in site.categories.tiny-paintings %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">

        <img src="{{ post.image.thumbnail }}">
      </noscript>
      <img class="lazyload fade-in" src="/assets/images/preload-150.png" data-src="{{ post.image.thumbnail }}" alt="">
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
