PaperFaces was an [illustration project](/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project/) by designer Michael Rose --- hey that's me! For two years I drew the faces of strangers everyday using an iPad, a stylus, and **Paper for iOS**. I occasionally post new portraits here, but certainly not as frequently as I used to.

If you scroll down far enough you can see how my technique evolved from faceless gestures into realistic portraits[^procreate].

<ul class="gallery-thumbnails">
{% for post in site.categories.paperfaces %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">
      <noscript>
        <img src="{{ post.image.thumbnail }}">
      </noscript>
      <img class="lazyload fade-in" src="/assets/images/preload-150.png" data-src="{{ post.image.thumbnail }}" alt="">
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
