As I continue to hack away at the design of Made Mistakes and improve on things, I try to release simplified Jekyll starters and themes after each major site revision.

The goal is to make things easier to build a Jekyll site using mine as a starter. Rather than having to sift through [my main repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll) and strip out the cruft before making it your own.

Below are all of the Jekyll starters I've open sourced thus far. Each "theme" contains all of the `_layouts`, `_includes`, Sass/CSS, JavaScript, and other sample files needed to build a site or blog. There are a lot of similarities between how they work and the file organization --- which should make switching and updating between them easier.

## Setup

The basic setup for each of my theme's is roughly the same:

  1. Install theme gem or fork the theme repository you'd like to use.
  2. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), etc)
  3. Update `_config.yml`, data files (found in `_data`), and replace sample posts and pages with your own.

For more specifics, review each theme's documentation by clicking on the **Setup Guide** buttons below.

Basically Basic is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as a substitute for the default --- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with six customizable skins
- Curriculum Vitæ/Resume layout powered by [JSON data](http://registry.jsonresume.org/)
- About page layout
