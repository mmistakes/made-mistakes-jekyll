## Disclosure policy

I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I'll get a percentage of that sale.

What this means for you:

- I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
- I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
- I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
- I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my disclosure policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.

Basically this means you are free to share, transmit, distribute, alter, transform, and build on my work just as long as you don't use it for commercial purposes without my prior written consent.

### Attribution

If you're inclined to give credit --- a link back to the source article attributed to either [Made Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com) or [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com) is good enough for me. If you don't want to attribute my content, hey that's cool too. Just don't go stealing stuff and republishing it as your own.
