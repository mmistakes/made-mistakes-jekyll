Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling designer from Buffalo, New York.

I'm into drawing [portraits of strangers](/procreate-paintings/) on an iPad Pro, eating popcorn and [chicken wings](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), watching dust collect on my [vinyl record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing single-player console exclusives[^videogames].

[^videogames]: **Nintendo Account:** mmistakes, **Xbox Live**: [anotherJPEG](https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamerTag=anotherJPEG), **PlayStation Network**: [anotherjpeg](https://my.playstation.com/profile/anotherjpeg)

When I'm not drawing on my iPad or releasing open source [Jekyll themes](/work/jekyll-themes/), I work as a web designer and content administrator for a leading global provider of laboratory products. On any given day I'm designing user-interfaces, building landing pages, and massaging content in and out of a CMS with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasn't enough to keep me busy --- I'm also the father of [twin girls](/tag/twins/) and married to a [subscription box addicted vegan](https://2littlerosebuds.com "Wendy Rose").

## About the site

So what does this all have to do with **made mistakes** and why did I name the website this? 

It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short, memorable sounding domain name.

In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash screen (hey remember those?) while I worked on building out my portfolio. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems ([Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) → [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/) → [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) → [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/)), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL databases.

I've since decided to abandon using a CMS in favor of black magick and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [generate flat files]({% post_url /articles/2012-03-19-going-static %}) for improved performance and security. Building layouts, stylesheets, feeds, and assets from scratch was challenging at first, but the knowledge gained made it all worth it.

## How to support Made Mistakes

I write tutorials and maintain a few [open source projects](https://github.com/mmistakes?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=) for fun. If you've found any of them useful, here's how you can show thanks:
