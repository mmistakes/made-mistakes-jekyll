  Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
  for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you
  are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO
  means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are
  backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting
  Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good
  On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in
  the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice
  keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic
  Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your
  Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the
  page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There
  should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one
  image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what
  if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page
  SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this
  4minute video for more information at. <a
