Today my 365 project titled [**PaperFaces**]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/) turns one --- holy smokes! In this past year I've managed to illustrate 476 portraits, make a ton of new *Paper friends*, burned through a few pen styli, and rekindled my passion for drawing. 

I honestly can't believe I've been drawing strangers for 365 days straight. I was half joking when I posted this and had no idea it would take off in the way that it did.

Here's to another fun year of blank faces. And to the thousands of you still waiting for portraits... I'm working on them, really I am.
