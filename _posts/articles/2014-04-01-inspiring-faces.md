It's been a lot of fun drawing the faces of strangers. But you know what's even better'? Having strangers draw you in return.

If you have an iOS device I encourage you to download the free [**Sktchy** app](http://www.sktchy.com/). You don't have to be an artist to use it --- in fact most using the app aren't. You just need to upload a selfie or two and hopefully inspire someone to create a work of art based on it.

I've been known to peruse the *Inspiration* tab in look of faces to draw. So if you've been patiently waiting for me to draw you as part of my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}), Sktchy might be a nice alternative.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Goofy homeless looking beards help get you noticed. Apparently Sktchy artists enjoy them because mine has managed to inspire a handful of drawings and sketches. Who knew?
