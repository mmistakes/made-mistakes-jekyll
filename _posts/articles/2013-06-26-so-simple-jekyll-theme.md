After having so much fun creating and releasing [my first open source Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), I figured I'd go at it again. So here be the fruit of that effort --- I call it [**So Simple Theme**](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme), a responsive Jekyll theme for words and photos.

**Like this theme?** I just released my third theme for Jekyll, with a sweet animated drop down menu, social sharing plugins, and a Grunt build script for theme development. I'm calling it HPSTR and you can [learn more about it here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-08-26-hpstr-jekyll-theme %}).
