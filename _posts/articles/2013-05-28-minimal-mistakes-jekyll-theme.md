Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of [my site](http://mademistakes.com) as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)**, a responsive Jekyll theme with editorial tendencies. 

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments. Content first --- other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for blog posts and pages.
* Simple and clean permalink structure[^1].

## Getting started

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/)
3. Make it your own and customize, customize, customize.

**Like this theme?** I just released my second theme for Jekyll, and if you ask me it's way better than *Minimal Mistakes*. I'm calling it [So Simple Theme]({{ site.url }}/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme.html) and it's essentially the same code base I use on *Made Mistakes* with simplification to make it easier for customizing. Documentation and a theme preview can be [found here](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme).
