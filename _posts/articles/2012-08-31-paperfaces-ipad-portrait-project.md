PaperFaces is an iPad drawing project by time traveling designer/illustrator Michael Rose --- that's me! It began in August 2012, when I started drawing portraits on my iPad using the [Paper by 53 app](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper). Each day when a drawing is completed, I post the image to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmistakes), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mmistakes), [Tumblr](http://mademistakes.tumblr.com), and mademistakes.com. The project will continue for the next year with the goal of completing a minimum of 730 portraits.

## Latest Portraits

I make every effort to update the gallery weekly with the newest portraits. If you absolutely have to see the latest PaperFaces drawing the second I finish it, best follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmistakes) or [Tumblr](http://mademistakes.tumblr.com). You won't be able to grab the full size originals (2048&times;1536 pixels) there, but...

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Draw Me! Draw Me! 

Unfortunately I am no longer taking volunteers for the project. If you'd like to commission me to illustrate your Twitter avatar fill out the PayPal form below. If you don't want me to use an avatar as reference leave a note in the special instructions field during checkout. Just let me know you're going to email me an image and send it to [michael@mademistakes.com](mailto:michael@mademistakes.com) or [tweet me the URL](http://twitter.com/mmistakes). 

Reference images should be high resolution to help accurately capture detail and likeness. Depending on the subject I sometimes draw the entire face (but usually don't), so keep that in mind before requesting a portrait.

### What is PaperFaces?

PaperFaces is the name that I coined for the portraits I was drawing with the Paper by 53 iPad app. Most of the Paper creations share the #MadeWithPaper hashtag, so I thought [#PaperFaces](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PaperFaces&src=typd) would fit in with that theme and decided to start tagging each portrait with it.

One night, out of sheer boredom, I decided I'd try to recreate <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/paperfaces-veganwendy-twitter-lg.jpg" title="iPad drawing of @veganwendy" rel="gallery">my wife's Twitter avatar</a> with Paper by 53. The positive response that resulted from that drawing prompted me to create one of <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/paperfaces-mmistakes-twitter-lg.jpg" title="iPad drawing of @mmistakes" rel="gallery">my own avatar</a>, which also went over well with my small group of Twitter and Instagram followers.

Due to the positive comments that I received, I decided to put a call out for more portrait volunteers. Without really considering the implications of my actions, I posted the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Retweet and I'll draw your profile picture using Paper on my iPad <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23MadeWithPaper">#MadeWithPaper</a> <a href="http://t.co/5oqH4bJt" title="http://twitter.com/mmistakes/status/240601384477659136/photo/1">twitter.com/mmistakes/stat…</a></p>&#8212; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmistakes/status/240601384477659136" data-datetime="2012-08-29T00:06:55+00:00">August 29, 2012</a></blockquote>

A few hours later, while grocery shopping with my wife, my iPhone started blowing up with retweet and @reply notifications. By the end of the day I had amassed around 300 volunteers and figured that turning it into a formal 365 day project might be fun.

When the count hit 700, I revised my initial goal of 365 to 730 (that's two a day for a year), due to the increased demand and not wanting to let anyone down. At around the same time, I started getting inquiries about the project, and whether I was accepting donations. At the suggestion of friends and some newfound supporters, I decided to put up a page to better explain the project and a PayPal button on the site for those who really really *really* wanted me to draw their portrait. [Request a PaperFaces drawing](#draw-me-draw-me) of your portrait now.

### Why the Blank Faces?

When I began the project I attempted to draw each face as detailed and accurately as possible. Even though I'm classically trained in illustration and the fine arts, photo realism isn't really "my bag." Part of what attracted me to Paper by 53 is its small toolset, lack of zoom, and focused color palettes. Trying to interpret each portrait using these constraints helped me to stumble across the whole "blank face" look and ultimately grow as an artist.

</figure>

### What's Your Process Like?

It all starts with a list. If there are any donators in the queue, I work on their portraits first. With over 1,700 portrait requests, I need a way to accurately check who has retweeted my initial post. I use [Favstar.fm](http://favstar.fm/) to view all my retweets and determine who is next, then grab their Twitter avatar and save it to my iPhone's camera roll. It's by no means a perfect system, and requests do fall through the cracks, but it's the best I've come up with so far.

Next, I fire up Paper on my iPad, draw a black square with the pen tool, and start roughing out the illustration with the pencil tool. What works well for me is resting an iPhone right on the iPad's screen so I can reference the original photograph as I draw. This allows me to relax in my living room with the family, instead of sitting at a desk in a studio.

Upon the portrait's completion, I share it from within the Paper by 53 app to Twitter and Tumblr, repost a cropped version to Instagram, and @reply the volunteer to notify them. If they donated or ask nicely, I send them a larger sized version in case they'd like to print it out. Using Evernote, I mark the drawing complete in my fancy PaperFaces notebook and move on to the next portrait.

And yes, I use a stylus. For the first 50 or so portraits I drew exclusively with a [Just Mobile AP-818 Universal AluPen Stylus][alupen] until the tip wore out. I moved on to a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen Stylus/Ink Pen][lunatik] and am now using a [Pogo Connect Bluetooth 4.0 Smart Pen][pogoconnect] with all that pressure sensitive goodness.

### When are You Going to Stop?

At the moment, there is a *waiting list* of about 1,300. Now I know what you're thinking, "this dude is never going to draw all those." Well, you're probably right. Though I am making progress and have drawn just shy of {{ site.categories.paperfaces | size }} portraits.

Working my day job as a designer, then spending the rest of the evening with my wife and twin baby girls doesn't leave much free time. Since this project is a fun diversion for myself, I allot a few hours each night to draw a portrait or two. On average, most portraits take me an hour, while others might take a few. It really depends on the complexity of the original photograph and how much detail I'm trying to capture.

## Video Tutorials

I use the term "tutorial" loosely. What you'll find here are glorified slideshows highlighting various stages of PaperFaces drawings. To create these I take periodic screenshots on the iPad and then generate a slideshow with them using Aperture for Mac OS X. It's not quite the same thing as a true speed painting video, but it does show how I attacked each of these portraits. I've also [documented my process]({{ site.url }}/articles/madewithpaper-drawing-guide.html "How I draw with Paper by 53 and an iPad") in the written form, if reading is  your thing.

**Update:** I've recently discovered [Reflector](http://www.reflectorapp.com/) which allows the screen of an iOS device to be mirrored on a Mac or PC via AirPlay. True speed painting videos here I come!

## Homages

I've been completely humbled by all the support and attention coming my way since I started this project. Drawing someone's portrait and having them thank you by returning the favor is something amazing. I'm featuring those drawings here, along with any that follow the "PaperFaces style."
