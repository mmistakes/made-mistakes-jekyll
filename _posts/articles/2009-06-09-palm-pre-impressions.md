Three days later I'm still impressed with the **Palm Pre**. As a user of Palm OS smartphones (Treo 600, Treo 650, Centro), I've come to rely on a proven feature set. The experience of having a device that organizes your life, makes phone calls, and connects online --- has remained unchanged. For the most part the Palm Pre meets or exceeds my expectations, with only a few minor back steps. After the break is a full rundown of my Palm Pre likes and dislikes (mostly software related), in no particular order.

### Palm Pre positives

*	Device feels great in your hands. *(Not sure where all the "it feels cheap" reviews came from.)*
*	Screen looks awesome!
*	The UI is very slick.
*	webOS is very responsive and allows **true multitasking**.
*	Notifications are handled very elegantly.
*	Push Gmail. *(Emails hit my Palm Pre before my desktop --- sweet!)*
*	Synergy and the way that it syncs with "the cloud." *(ie: Google, Facebook, etc)*
*	Battery life. *(I can easily make it through a workday which is all I had hoped for)*
*	Removable battery.
*	Physical keyboard. *(Yes it's small, but coming from a Centro I have no problems banging out txts or emails.)*
*	Plugging in via USB let's you access the ringtone and wallpaper folders, to easily add your own to the device.
*	Is capable of syncing with iTunes to add music, podcasts, videos, movies, or photos.
*	Backups every day to your Palm Profile --- just in case you need to restore your device after a wipe.
*	GPS and Sprint Navigation for turn by turn directions.

### Palm Pre negatives

*	Having to pay $30 for the Classic app. Booooooooo!
*	Having to use Classic at all! Let's get true webOS versions on the App Catalog so I can stop using Classic for a few archaic applications.
*	No option to make *Tasks repeatable* like the Palm OS version. *(Maybe I'm the only one who relies on this --- I dunno)*
*	Tasks don't sync up with Google Tasks. *(I'm sure this will happen eventually)*
*	Flipping through the Calendar is painfully slow.
*	No agenda view in Calendar.
*	Sprint Navigation doesn't pull in your contacts' addresses if they're coming from Google or Facebook accounts.
*	Can't change the notification sound. *(I have no desire to change it but it would be nice to have the option)*
*	Can't assign a default ringtone for unknown callers like in Palm OS devices.
*	Reception issues. *(I've never had more than 2 bars at my house with the **Centro**, but the Palm Pre seems to average much less and I've experienced a few dropped calls)*
*	Landscape mode is limited to only a few applications
*	USB port cover seems cheaply made and I feel like I'm going to break it off every time I open it.
*	Device does get warm after prolonged usage. *(To be fair so did my Centro)*
*	Audio speaker isn't that loud.

So there you have it. Can't say that I was excited about the thought of paying an extra $20 a month for the required Sprint Everything Data plan. But seeing how I'm getting more anytime minutes, Sprint Navigation, Sprint TV, and nights that start at 7pm instead of 9pm --- I'll live. My only real Palm Pre complaints stem from its software or lack of applications, which I'm pretty confident will be addressed with future firmware and software updates. I hope ;-)
