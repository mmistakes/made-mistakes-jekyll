When I edit drawing footage I captured from an iPad, I like to speed up the final movie to around 4-5 minutes max. Keeps the video more interesting and fun to watch.

At this speed it can be hard to observe exactly what is going on and looks more like a magic trick if you ask me. YouTube has bumped my account allowing uploads over 15 minutes so I decided to try a longer edit. I'm not entirely sure what the hard limit is, but I decided against uploading the 1 hour and 23 minute real time capture, and instead went with this 17 minute cut.

Even at 17 minutes it's fairly boring to watch, but maybe 2 or 3 of you will enjoy it.
