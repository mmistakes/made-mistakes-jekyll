Looks like I might actually get an **iPhone 4** on launch day. Took AT&T all day to process the order I made at 6:50 AM EST (6/15/2010), but everything is looking good. Guessing I had no problems getting through because I was a new customer and didn't have to deal with the servers looking up my account info for upgrade eligibility.

Now I'm just worried that my existing number is going to be ported over today from Sprint and I'll be without service on my **Palm Pre**. From the looks of it AT&T confirmed my number port for 12:30pm today (6/16/2010). Sure hope it doesn't take effect until I activate via iTunes next week.

Now the waiting game begins...
