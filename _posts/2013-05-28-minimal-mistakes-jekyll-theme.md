Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of [my site](http://mademistakes.com) as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)**, a responsive Jekyll theme with editorial tendencies. 

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments. Content first --- other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for blog posts and pages.
* Simple and clean permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*
