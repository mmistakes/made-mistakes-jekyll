I've always been one of those guys who didn't understand why women enjoyed receiving dead flowers. So two years ago when I decided to propose marriage to [my girlfriend Wendy](http://2littlerosebuds.com/), I was at a slight disadvantage --- I'm not a romantic, I don't do romance.

The ring was purchased, but the method of delivering it eluded me. Easter Sunday was quickly approaching and the idea of doing a scavenger hunt that ultimately led to the ring and me on one knee, popped in my head.

I wrote around ten clues that I sealed in plastic eggs and hid around our house the night before while Wendy showered. In the morning I woke her up, promising her a little diversion that she thought would end at an Easter basket full of *vegan treats*. At least that's what I alluded to, so she'd get the hell out of bed!

Clue after clue, egg after egg, I led Wendy throughout the house until she found the last one...

I dropped to one knee, she dropped an F-bomb... and then said yes after realizing what just happened. Six months later, on October 2nd, 2010 we were married at [*The Roycroft Inn*](http://www.roycroftinn.com/) in East Aurora, New York. Come this fall, we're expecting to double the size of our family with the arrival of the twins, and I couldn't be happier!
