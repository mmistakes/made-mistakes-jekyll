Portrait of David G. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/CIyk0D). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

I could have easily spent another 5 hours meticulously rendering beard whiskers and cleaning up some sloppy color transitions. But at some point you just have to put your kid to bed to rest and grow.
